	Abstract = {Background and Aims Climate change is advancing the leaf-out times of many plant species and mostly extending the growing season in temperate ecosystems. Laboratory experiments using twig cuttings from woody plant species present an affordable, easily replicated approach to investigate the relative importance of factors such as winter chilling, photoperiod, spring warming and frost tolerance on the leafing-out times of plant communities. This Viewpoint article demonstrates how the results of these experiments deepen our understanding beyond what is possible via analyses of remote sensing and field observation data, and can be used to improve climate change forecasts of shifts in phenology, ecosystem processes and ecological interactions. Scope The twig method involves cutting dormant twigs from trees, shrubs and vines on a single date or at intervals over the course of the winter and early spring, placing them in containers of water in controlled environments, and regularly recording leaf-out, flowering or other phenomena. Prior to or following leaf-out or flowering, twigs may be assigned to treatment groups for experiments involving temperature, photoperiod, frost, humidity and more. Recent studies using these methods have shown that winter chilling requirements and spring warming strongly affect leaf-out and flowering times of temperate trees and shrubs, whereas photoperiod requirements are less important than previously thought for most species. Invasive plant species have weaker winter chilling requirements than native species in temperate ecosystems, and species that leaf-out early in the season have greater frost tolerance than later leafing species. Conclusions This methodology could be extended to investigate additional drivers of leaf-out phenology, leaf senescence in the autumn, and other phenomena, and could be a useful tool for education and outreach. Additional ecosystems, such as boreal, southern hemisphere and sub-tropical forests, could also be investigated using dormant twigs to determine the drivers of leaf-out times and how these ecosystems will be affected by climate change.},

@article{Caffarra:2011qf,
	Abstract = {Despite experimental evidence of the individual and interactive effects of photoperiod and temperature on bud growth, photoperiod has not yet been effectively accounted for in models of budburst. However, in some tree species, such as Betula pubescens (birch), photoperiod has an important role in phenological control, and its inclusion in process-based models of budburst might affect phenological projections under climate change scenarios. The aim of the present study was to integrate photoperiod into a process-based phenological model (Chuine 2000; J Theor Biol 207: 337-347; Unified model), using experimental findings in which photoperiod was found to significantly affect budburst in B. pubescens (Caffarra et al. 2011; Clim Res 46: 147-157, this issue). The effect of photoperiod was integrated into the model at 2 levels. Firstly, photoperiod, in interaction with temperature, affects the course of dormancy induction. Secondly, photoperiod modifies the response to temperature during the phase of forcing. The resulting model (DORMPHOT) for the simulation of birch budburst was fitted to a large phenological dataset, including data from different latitudes, and validated with 7 datasets from 4 different European countries. Besides giving more biological realism to the model, the newly introduced mechanisms improved its predictive performance. The DORMPHOT model outperformed the Unified model, the linear regression model (budburst date vs. spring average temperature), and the UniForc model. It also proved to be more accurate at predicting budburst in extremely warm years, which suggests it might be more reliable than previous models when using future climate change scenarios.},

	Abstract = {Flowering times are well-documented indicators of the ecological effects of climate change and are linked to numerous ecosystem processes and trophic interactions. Dozens of studies have shown that flowering times for many spring-flowering plants have become earlier as a result of recent climate change, but it is uncertain if flowering times will continue to advance as temperatures rise. Here, we used long-term flowering records initiated by Henry David Thoreau in 1852 and Aldo Leopold in 1935 to investigate this question. Our analyses demonstrate that record-breaking spring temperatures in 2010 and 2012 in Massachusetts, USA, and 2012 in Wisconsin, USA, resulted in the earliest flowering times in recorded history for dozens of spring-flowering plants of the eastern United States. These dramatic advances in spring flowering were successfully predicted by historical relationships between flowering and spring temperature spanning up to 161 years of ecological change. These results demonstrate that numerous temperate plant species have yet to show obvious signs of physiological constraints on phenological advancement in the face of climate change.},

@article{yu2010,
	Abstract = {Climate change has caused advances in spring phases of many plant species. Theoretically, however, strong warming in winter could slow the fulfillment of chilling requirements, which may delay spring phenology. This phenomenon should be particularly pronounced in regions that are experiencing rapid temperature increases and are characterized by highly temperature-responsive vegetation. To test this hypothesis, we used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ratio method to determine the beginning, end, and length of the growing season of meadow and steppe vegetation of the Tibetan Plateau in Western China between 1982 and 2006. We then correlated observed phenological dates with monthly temperatures for the entire period on record. For both vegetation types, spring phenology initially advanced, but started retreating in the mid-1990s in spite of continued warming. Together with an advancing end of the growing season for steppe vegetation, this led to a shortening of the growing period. Partial least-squares regression indicated that temperatures in both winter and spring had strong effects on spring phenology. Although warm springs led to an advance of the growing season, warm conditions in winter caused a delay of the spring phases. This delay appeared to be related to later fulfillment of chilling requirements. Because most plants from temperate and cold climates experience a period of dormancy in winter, it seems likely that similar effects occur in other environments. Continued warming may strengthen this effect and attenuate or even reverse the advancing trend in spring phenology that has dominated climate-change responses of plants thus far.},

@article{Heide:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Blackcurrant is a short day plant that ceases growing and initiates flowers at photoperiods shorter than a critical length. Surprisingly, however, the flowering response was found to be several-fold stronger in the near-critical photoperiod of 15 h than in shorter photoperiods down to 10 h (Heide and Sonsteby, 2011). This unusual response of a short day plant was confirmed by the present experiments where plants were exposed to 15 and 10 h photoperiods for 5 weeks at 18 degrees C. Also, plants exposed to naturally decreasing day-length from July, produced significantly more flowers than plants exposed to the shorter day-lengths in August. Furthermore, plants exposed to controlled photoperiods decreasing from 15 h to 10 h responded in much the same way as those in constant 15 h, while the reverse changes from 10 h to 15 h mimicked the response to constant 10 h photoperiod. Superior flower induction was always associated with a gradual reduction in growth rate followed by a delayed cessation of growth, while the sparse-flowering plants underwent an early and abrupt cessation of growth. We therefore conclude that the prompt growth cessation induced by an abrupt change to SD well below the 'critical length also interferes with flowering by arresting floral initiation at an early stage. Accordingly, the optimum photoperiod for flowering in black currant must be short enough to allow flower initiation and still long enough to prevent premature dormancy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
