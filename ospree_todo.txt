OSPREE to do


<><><><><><><><><>
Where we’re at with issues:
<><><><><><><><><>
**
** To do now:

** Review! ** 
- #91 - ALL, row.names=FALSE when you write out data
- how to clean R code, see the code I added, please add to it!

Cleaning and merging discussion:

(*) Help Dan with git issues. 
(*) bb_analysis/cleaning …
(*) #81 multiresp issue!
(*) Discuss how to adjust clean_duplicates.R in main cleaning file (issue #79)
(*) Discuss what to delete in clean_moreduplicates.R (this should or could close issue #52 also) 
(*) check out: cleaning/_cleaningREADME.txt
(*) #84 - Go through all cleaning files line by line

Ailene:
#24 - non-numeric chilltemps in ospree_clean

Cat: has closed #72, #93, #56

Me:
#42 - Merging and cleaning: need to have all the source files working! And then check all the files
#29 - response and response time issue (with Lizzie and Dan together currently)
#58 - Deal with labgroups
#90 - Make fake data for Stan models - check for 0, 1s
#76 - Fix non-matching authors for labgroups
#84 - Go through all cleaning files line by line 

Dan:
#29 - response and response time issue (close!) 
#84 - Go through all cleaning files line by line

Nacho: (Lizzie needs to update … next time!)
#81 - DaystoBB Cleaning: remove rows with multiresponse=TRUE (select highest percentage)
#95 - Whatever happened with multiresp.R?
#97 - finish BB cleaning
#79 - check duplicates
#84 - Go through all cleaning files line by line

**
** To do soon:
My 23 Apr 2017 notes:
- Subset to 3-way only expts.
- Nah, subset to 2-way only expts, and then break up chilling into levels and see if we can model that
- Do varcomp analysis versus 2 or 3-way ANOVA analysis …?

convert photoperiod to long days or short days?
remove chilling from model to check?
remove photoperiod from model to check?
should we look at subsets of data? - just look at studies that only looked at all three?
assign chilling to different values for each site?
Lizzie - redo the ggplot figures by species and for one species try to visualize by datasetID the treatments/data
figure out chilling threshold for each species — how on earth to do this??
what is the common photoperiod and throw out outliers

**
** To do later:

#80 - Clean other columns that we may someday use (low priority)
#82 - deal with multiple varieties, cultivars, populations
#30 - response again (NA issue)
#57 - Something hierarchical that is not quite species?
#51 - Add flowering data!
