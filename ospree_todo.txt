OSPREE to do

Where we’re at with issues:

** To do now:

19 July 2017
- Dan is working on strawberry questions (3 different types of varieties)
- Dan and Cat are working on: variation in photoperiod sensitivity (will return with hypotheses) 
- Nacho: Spatial distribution of trees … use OSPREE data project forward for budbreak … then compare with realized distribution. 	
	- Compare with our final model versus predictions from full-blown phenological models
	- See how our model, versus best model, versus observed niche compare…. if they work well, maybe you can predict to other species. 
- Dan: Conceptual piece on how people actually have done experiments. Home-site studies versus using them for global studies…. 
- Ailene votes ditto for conceptual paper: remember this was for a growth chamber study
- Lizzie suggests, for conceptual: What has changed in experimental design before/after climate change.
- Ailene: Compare field and experimental chilling: are results similar? 
- Ailene: How and when is photoperiod important? (Big question!) Does altering photoperiod affect responses, does it reduce chilling or photoperiod? 
- Look at CU vs. FU at budburst … 	
- Nacho: How does our model vary across space?
- Dan & Ailene: treat photo, forcing and chilling all as random effects 
- Do models: GDD vs. chilling * photoperiod
- Take out photoperiod, just look at chilling x forcing…. 
- Conceptual paper first and then we can publish it once crazy model is done.

My 23 Apr 2017 notes for analyses:
- Subset to 3-way only expts.
- Nah, subset to 2-way only expts, and then break up chilling into levels and see if we can model that
- Do varcomp analysis versus 2 or 3-way ANOVA analysis …?

convert photoperiod to long days or short days?
remove chilling from model to check?
remove photoperiod from model to check?
should we look at subsets of data? - just look at studies that only looked at all three?
assign chilling to different values for each site?
Lizzie - redo the ggplot figures by species and for one species try to visualize by datasetID the treatments/data
figure out chilling threshold for each species — how on earth to do this??
what is the common photoperiod and throw out outliers

**
** To do later:

#80 - Clean other columns that we may someday use (low priority)
#82 - deal with multiple varieties, cultivars, populations
#30 - response again (NA issue)
#57 - Something hierarchical that is not quite species?
#51 - Add flowering data!
