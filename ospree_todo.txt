OSPREE to do


<><><><><><><><><>
Where we’re at with issues:
<><><><><><><><><>
**
** To do now:

Review:
- #91 - ALL, row.names=FALSE when you write out data

Cleaning and merging discussion:
(a) check out: cleaning/_cleaningREADME.txt, esp. 8-9 (9 is still not used in main cleaning file) - can delete this file and all references to it, now handled in chilling folder
(b) chilling folder looks good!
(c) bb_analysis/cleaning needs work … to discuss together (and see all the files in just bb_analysis, like bb_mergeall.R)

Cleaning files and folders:
cleaning/todo_ailene.R


Ailene:
#81 - DaystoBB Cleaning: remove rows with multiresponse=TRUE (select highest percentage)
#24 - non-numeric chilltemps in ospree_clean
#88 - Add growing lat/long to chilling code estimates (closed, but I am leaving it here until the code runs on my machine)
#95 - Whatever happened with multiresp.R?

Cat:
#72 (Lizzie re-opened) - convert degree days to days if possible … (… and, if you need to add in response timeonly, make sure anything that needs to be moved or have “timeonly” added happens in clean_responsetime.R, see line 78… and check with Dan). 
#93 - BB>200


Me:
#42 - Merging and cleaning: need to have all the source files working! And then check all the files
#29 - response and response time issue (with Dan currently)
#58 - Deal with labgroups
#90 - Make fake data for Stan models
#76 - Fix non-matching authors for labgroups

Dan:
#29 - response and response time issue
#93 - BB>200: Finalize notes on Schwartz81
#96 - add metadata to plot file (R file)
#97 - finish BB cleaning


Nacho:
#87 - Make figures based on rstanarm models and the model I built
#79 - check duplicates
#92 - master file for cleaning BB? 
#95 - Whatever happened with multiresp.R?
#97 - finish BB cleaning

**
** To do soon:
#84 - Go through all cleaning files line by line


**
** To do later:

#80 - Clean other columns that we may someday use (low priority)
#82 - deal with multiple varieties, cultivars, populations
#30 - response again (NA issue)
#57 - Something hierarchical that is not quite species?
#51 - Add flowering data!
