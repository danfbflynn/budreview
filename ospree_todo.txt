OSPREE to do


<><><><><><><><><>
Where we’re at with issues:
<><><><><><><><><>
**
** To do now:

Review:
- #91 - ALL, row.names=FALSE when you write out data
- #95 - Whatever happened with multiresp.R?

Ailene:
#81 - DaystoBB Cleaning: remove rows with multiresponse=TRUE (select highest percentage)
#24 - non-numeric chilltemps in ospree_clean
#88 - Add growing lat/long to chilling code estimates (closed, but I am leaving it here until the code runs on my machine)


Cat:
#72 (Lizzie re-opened) - convert degree days to days if possible … (… and, if you need to add in response timeonly, make sure anything that needs to be moved or have “timeonly” added happens in clean_responsetime.R, see line 78… and check with Dan). 
#93 - BB>200


Me:
#42 - Merging and cleaning: delete the extra cleaning BB file in main cleaning folders
#29 - response and response time issue
#58 - Deal with labgroups
#90 - Make fake data for Stan models

Dan:
#29 - response and response time issue
#93 - BB>200


Nacho:
#87 - Make figures based on rstanarm models and the model I built
#79 - check duplicates
#92 - master file for cleaning BB? 

**
** To do soon:
#84 - Go through all cleaning files line by line


**
** To do later:

#80 - Clean other columns that we may someday use (low priority)
#82 - deal with multiple varieties, cultivars, populations
#30 - response again (NA issue)
#76 - Fix non-matching authors for labgroups
#56 - Create a common subset of the rows for the paper
#57 - Something hierarchical that is not quite species?
#51 - Add flowering data!
