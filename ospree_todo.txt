OSPREE to do


<><><><><><><><><>
Where we’re at with issues:
<><><><><><><><><>
**
** To do now:

** Review! ** 
- how to clean R code, see the code I added, please add to it!

Cleaning and merging discussion:

(*) check out: cleaning README files (if we have time)
(*) #84 - Go through all cleaning files line by line (everyone!)
(*) #106 - phenstage, discuss if needed

As of 5 July 2017, I tagged what we should discuss, but as a reminder go through these issues slowly:
#95 (multiresp, summary towards end)
#84 (clean everything … everyone should check this!)
#81 (multiresp part 2, see my notes from 1 July, also check that notes on 24 May are all handled)
#42 (merging and cleaning)

**
** To do soon:
My 23 Apr 2017 notes:
- Subset to 3-way only expts.
- Nah, subset to 2-way only expts, and then break up chilling into levels and see if we can model that
- Do varcomp analysis versus 2 or 3-way ANOVA analysis …?

convert photoperiod to long days or short days?
remove chilling from model to check?
remove photoperiod from model to check?
should we look at subsets of data? - just look at studies that only looked at all three?
assign chilling to different values for each site?
Lizzie - redo the ggplot figures by species and for one species try to visualize by datasetID the treatments/data
figure out chilling threshold for each species — how on earth to do this??
what is the common photoperiod and throw out outliers

**
** To do later:

#80 - Clean other columns that we may someday use (low priority)
#82 - deal with multiple varieties, cultivars, populations
#30 - response again (NA issue)
#57 - Something hierarchical that is not quite species?
#51 - Add flowering data!
