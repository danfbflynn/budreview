OSPREE to do


<><><><><><><><><>
Where we’re at with issues:
<><><><><><><><><>
**
** To do now:
Cleaning and merging discussion:
(*) check out: cleaning README files (if I have time)
(*) #84 - Go through all cleaning files line by line (everyone!)

Ailene: 
- #103: Did she figure out why we’re losing the Zohner data or any other details … 
- #84: Questions to Cat on 10 Jun, all set? 

Cat:
- #106 (phenstage) — should be closable once Cat checks it.
- #84 (all cleaning) - photoperiod issues


**
** 
My 23 Apr 2017 notes for analyses:
- Subset to 3-way only expts.
- Nah, subset to 2-way only expts, and then break up chilling into levels and see if we can model that
- Do varcomp analysis versus 2 or 3-way ANOVA analysis …?

convert photoperiod to long days or short days?
remove chilling from model to check?
remove photoperiod from model to check?
should we look at subsets of data? - just look at studies that only looked at all three?
assign chilling to different values for each site?
Lizzie - redo the ggplot figures by species and for one species try to visualize by datasetID the treatments/data
figure out chilling threshold for each species — how on earth to do this??
what is the common photoperiod and throw out outliers

**
** To do later:

#80 - Clean other columns that we may someday use (low priority)
#82 - deal with multiple varieties, cultivars, populations
#30 - response again (NA issue)
#57 - Something hierarchical that is not quite species?
#51 - Add flowering data!
