OSPREE to do


<><><><><><><><><>
Where we’re at with issues:
<><><><><><><><><>
**
** To do now:

Ailene:
#59 - Check the provenance.lat and provenance.long of some collection locations (almost done)
#81 - DaystoBB Cleaning: remove rows with multiresponse=TRUE (select highest percentage)
#24 - non-numeric chilltemps in ospree_clean
#88 - Add growing lat/long to chilling code estimates


Cat:
#72 - convert degree days to days if possible … Cat, were you working on this? If so, can you update the issue with where you’re at. (If you can change any, make a file to change them in bb_analysis cleaning… and, if you need to add in response time only, write “timeonly” in the response column, see clean_responsetime, line 78). 
#86 - Finish chilling units by forcing units figures (Cat — maybe make one set for days to BB and one set using just thermaltime studies?)


Me:
#42 - Merging and cleaning: delete the extra cleaning BB file in main cleaning folders
#29 - response and response time issue
#58 - Deal with labgroups


Dan:
Next time: look at figures on experimental relationships with latitude 
#29 - response and response time issue


Nacho:
#87 - Make figures based on rstanarm models and the model I built
#79 - check duplicates

**
** To do soon:
#84 - Go through all cleaning files line by line


**
** To do later:

#80 - Clean other columns that we may someday use (low priority)
#82 - deal with multiple varieties, cultivars, populations
#30 - response again (NA issue)
#76 - Fix non-matching authors for labgroups
#56 - Create a common subset of the rows for the paper
#57 - Something hierarchical that is not quite species?
#51 - Add flowering data!
