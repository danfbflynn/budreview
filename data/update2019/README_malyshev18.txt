Below by Lizzie (see also issue #354):

This paper was entered with a constant field sample date originally but you can see in Figure 1 that there were many field sample dates and that how there is chilling variation.

I originally suggested scraping Fig 1, but Dan B figured out Fig 2 on the x axis may have what we need.

Darwin separately scraped the x axis of Fig 2 (see ospree_2019update_DSSaddmaly18 file).
