Dear Catherine

There is no need for any additional information as long your project
comply with our data use Data Use Policy (data must not used for
commercial projects).

Nevertheless it's good that you sent this mail as the download on the
website is not up-to-date. You can access the current export over the
link below, it's an 130MB zip - deflated ~1GB.

Due to memory issues on my side I have to split it into several files,
each with 400000 observations. They come in ASCII format, separated by
";", line endings CRLF (Windows style)

Columns should be self explaining, except
cult_season:
0..not applicable,1..summer cereals - sowing in spring, 2..winter
cereals - sowing in autumn

phase_id:
0..99 are equal BBCH coding, above own definition: the complete list can
be found at:
http://www.pep725.eu/pep725_phase.php

Finally good luck for your project and let us know the results! If there
are any questions, don't hesitate to get into contact with me/us

Regards Markus
