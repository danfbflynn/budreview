STOP and think, how do we really want to plot these? As percentage of studies doing one thing or totals?!

# of studies by year
# of species by year
# of studies manipulating each cue by year

X\% of studies manipulated which interacting cues? (i.e., how many studies manipulate 1 cues, 2 cues, 3 cues ... of those manipulating 1 cue, what is the breakdown by cue etc.)

maps of cues manipulated (see Dan B.’s work)
 
maps of each cue manipulated

materials figure or numbers?
