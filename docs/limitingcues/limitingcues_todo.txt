General to do...
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
(1) Add in all the refs people gave that I do not have (see comments folder)
(2) Outline: Need to integrate the stuff hanging out in 'Questions' into the outline
(3) Need to deal with this section of outline: 

\item Studies using only long-term observational data must test for and be up front about correlations in predictor variables (e.g., chilling, forcing and daylength often covary) and thus what they can and cannot rule out. \todo[inline]{Do we need this? And/or are there any ways to untangle cues using long-term data?} % AKE: Also add: can we use any long-term observational data to look at interactive cues at all? for example, elevational gradient studies or gradients/locatison with small scale  but strongmicroclimate variations (photoperiod should be consistent- more or less- though forcing and chilling might be quite different, for example).

Figures to make for the concept paper …
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

FIGURES that are DONE (more or less):
PEP725 spp. 1980 figures
PEP725 spp. Future figures


STOP and think, how do we really want to plot these? As percentage of studies doing one thing or totals?!

# of studies by year
# of species by year
# of studies manipulating each cue by year

X\% of studies manipulated which interacting cues? (i.e., how many studies manipulate 1 cues, 2 cues, 3 cues ... of those manipulating 1 cue, what is the breakdown by cue etc.)

maps of cues manipulated (see Dan B.’s work)
 
maps of each cue manipulated

materials figure or numbers?

To do items …
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
Make a f(x) to make the following the figures:
	yvar~latitude
	yvar~year
	where yvar is:
		- temp (max, min, range)
		- photo (max, min, range)
		- chill days (max, min, range)
		- chill temp (max, min, range)

Heat map for photo by temp (temp is a combo of chilling and forcing temps)
	- relatedly, can use PCO (0/1 data) and PCA for analyses if needed

# of studies than manipulated which cue each year, include: chill, photo, force, field.sample
# of studies that manipulated more than one cue each year done by: chill, photo, force, field.sample

% or n of studies with n >= 2 cues of photo, temp, force: one panel EACH for 1-2 field sample, and >2 field sample date

Assign to Dan or Cat?
# studies per year, # species per year (color-coded by crop or not)
