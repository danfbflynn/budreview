General to do...
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
(1) Add in all the refs people gave that I do not have (see comments folder)
(2) Also go through outline where a lot of refs are just written out.
(3) Outline: Re-read outline one last time and let co-authors know

Figures to make for the concept paper …
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

FIGURES that are DONE (more or less):
PEP725 spp. 1980 figures
PEP725 spp. Future figures


STOP and think, how do we really want to plot these? As percentage of studies doing one thing or totals?!

# of studies by year
# of species by year
# of studies manipulating each cue by year

X\% of studies manipulated which interacting cues? (i.e., how many studies manipulate 1 cues, 2 cues, 3 cues ... of those manipulating 1 cue, what is the breakdown by cue etc.)

maps of cues manipulated (see Dan B.’s work)
 
maps of each cue manipulated

materials figure or numbers?

To do items …
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
Work on (issue #174):
0. See what of the stuff below this list is done and delete/add!
1. Make 3 panel version of heat map
2. % of studies that manipulated each cue (table)
3. photo x chill map
4. chilling x weinberger: make heatmap version once I have corrected how we count fieldsample dates! (only count sample dates that are two weeks apart)
5. re-make maps and check on lat/long

Make a f(x) to make the following the figures:
	yvar~latitude
	yvar~year
	where yvar is:
		- temp (max, min, range)
		- photo (max, min, range)
		- chill days (max, min, range)
		- chill temp (max, min, range)

Heat map for photo by temp (temp is a combo of chilling and forcing temps)
	- relatedly, can use PCO (0/1 data) and PCA for analyses if needed

# of studies than manipulated which cue each year, include: chill, photo, force, field.sample
# of studies that manipulated more than one cue each year done by: chill, photo, force, field.sample

% or n of studies with n >= 2 cues of photo, temp, force: one panel EACH for 1-2 field sample, and >2 field sample date

Assign to Dan or Cat?
# studies per year, # species per year (color-coded by crop or not)
