Figures to make for the concept paper …

FIGURES that are DONE (more or less):
PEP725 spp. 1980 figures
PEP725 spp. Future figures


STOP and think, how do we really want to plot these? As percentage of studies doing one thing or totals?!

# of studies by year
# of species by year
# of studies manipulating each cue by year

X\% of studies manipulated which interacting cues? (i.e., how many studies manipulate 1 cues, 2 cues, 3 cues ... of those manipulating 1 cue, what is the breakdown by cue etc.)

maps of cues manipulated (see Dan B.’s work)
 
maps of each cue manipulated

materials figure or numbers?

\item 
\item Number of studies by year (OSPREE) \emph{Other ideas?!} Such as, number of species studied by year. Show crops or remove or show separately?
\item Map of studies, color coded or such by which of the three cues they manipulated
\item Variation in treatments across space (photo/chill/force)
\item Variation in treatments across time (graph with year on $x$-axis or divide time in half or such? 
\item Not a figure, but analysis-related: X\% of studies manipulated which interacting cues? (i.e., how many studies manipulate 1 cues, 2 cues, 3 cues ... of those manipulating 1 cue, what is the breakdown by cue etc.)
