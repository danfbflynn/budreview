\begin{abstract}
Climate change has shifted plant phenology globally, with average shifts of 4-6 days/\textdegree C and some species shifting several weeks. Globally, such shifts have been some of the most reported and most predictable biological impacts of climate change. This predictability comes from decades of research, which have outlined the major cues that drive most studied plant phenology: temperatures (including spring warming and winter chilling) and daylength. Further simplifying predictions, spring temperatures are often the dominant cue in nature, making linear models of heat sums often excellent at predicting interannual variation in phenology. Yet as climate change has marched on, new research has uncovered failures to predict the current observed changes, with many shifts appearing more muted over certain time periods or in certain locations. Here we argue that such inaccurate predictions are most likely due to simple models that neglect to consider other major cues---especially winter chilling and daylength, which moderate and shape plant phenological responses to spring warming. We highlight how over 60 years of research in controlled environments can improve predictions for when, where and how the interactive effects of other cues will impact simple linear predictions. Finally, we discuss how a new generation of controlled environment experiments could rapidly improve our predictive capacity for woody plant phenology in coming decades.  
\end{abstract}

\noindent \emph{Main message (and, really, it's important):} if you want to project climate change impacts, you need to focus on relevant changes in all three cues. The relevant changes part is about comparing cues, the all three cues is about interactive cues.}

% Ask yourself: What do people need to do to fit better models and predict limits to shifts?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduction 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Climate change: it means all that work on phenology comes due ... now! (Short opening paragraph)
\item There has been a lot of focus on forcing but really it's more complicated
\begin{enumerate}
\item Think about one tree\footnote{Here we pick one PEP725 species that is well-represented spatially for leafout or budburst data (Cat?)}
\item Look at its distribution!\footnote{Here, we show a distribution map (Nacho?), maybe with some spring climate and/or phenology mapped on it.}
\item Cues are adapted to high climate variation! (New term? Cue range limits? As in the limits of cues as seen over a species' range, what do you think?)
\end{enumerate}
\item These cues may create critical non-linear responses that most current methods cannot predict, but measuring them and thinking about how they will interactively produce future phenology is hard because:
\begin{enumerate}
\item They are expected to interact; cues may compensate for other cues; meaning they mask one another
\item They vary across species and possibly within species across the range
\item They are hard to measure.\footnote{Somewhere in here need to sneak in that we will focus on woody species phenology, because it's where we understand things best and thus should build from there.}
\item To some extent, you haven't really had to measure them to get decent predictions (CITES Primack linear paper)
\end{enumerate}
\item Add in paragraph here on predictions starting to fail (CITES Fu paper, Tibet etc.), see abstract
\item How do you measure them there cues?
\begin{enumerate}
\item Methods especially lame at understanding these cues (and thus predicting non-linearities): models from long-term observational data ... somehow mention experiments maybe?
\item Try to comment on the two issues at play here: the data type (e.g., long-term) versus the model type (e.g., linear and sans interactions?)
\item The one method designed to look at all these cues is controlled environment (generally growth chamber) studies
\end{enumerate}
\item Growth chamber studies
\begin{enumerate}
\item Can manipulate all three cues (and even more, humidity etc. nod?)
\item Are often focused on interactions (unlike other methods)
\item Have been done \emph{forever}. But oddly, never really reviewed.
\item  ...and are often poorly integrated into current climate change literature. Including debates where they are critical, like about photoperiod.
\end{enumerate}
\item Our aim is to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Review how three major phenological cues for woody plant phenology will shift in coming decades with anthropogenic climate change
\item Review of the three major phenological cues from growth chamber studies over the past 60 (70?) years
\item Highlight their critical relevance to climate change research
\item Compare treatments from controlled environment studies to predicted shifts in cues with climate change.  
\item Showcase how growth chamber studies can be best designed to better understand these interactive cues (paths forward). 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item Review how cues will shift with climate change (we could have figures of change in temp across the distibution here?)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Forcing: the world will get warmer %\todo[inline]{This got me wondering if we should ask Ben Cook if he would collaborate.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Higher altitude and arctic places will warm more
\item Give range of warming depending on different scenarios
\item Minima warm more than maxima (night-time temps)
\end{enumerate}
\item Chilling, see forcing but ... 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Chilling only occurs between certain temps so some places accumulate more chilling with warming
\item And there is so much we don't know about how chilling works and interacts with forcing (sequential model, parallel models etc.)
\end{enumerate}
\item Photoperiod: Shifts with phenology
\begin{enumerate}
\item Changes in forcing and chilling will alter the photoperiod that matters so to speak
\item Need more here ... 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item Review of the three major phenological cues from growth chamber studies over the last 67 years % 2014-1947
\begin{enumerate}
\item Quick intro to the data, how long, which cues .... 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fig: Number of studies by year (OSPREE)\footnote{Other ideas: number of species studied by year. Show crops or remove or show separately?}
\item Fig: Map of studies, color coded or such by which of the three cues they manipulated
\end{enumerate}
\item For each of the three cues:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  X\% of studies manipulated that cue
\item Variation across space, continent and time (and species)? 
\item Fig: Variation in treatments across space (photo/chill/force)
\item Fig: Variation in treatments across time (graph with year on $x$-axis or divide time in half or such? 
\end{enumerate}
\item X\% of studies manipulated which interacting cues? (i.e., how many studies manipulate 1 cues, 2 cues, 3 cues ... of those manipulating 1 cue, what is the breakdown by cue etc.)
\end{enumerate}
\item Random other bits to fit in
\begin{enumerate}
\item Say something about material (seeds/saplings/cuttings)?
\item We need better non-linear models.
\end{enumerate}
\item What cues will be most limiting with climate change? How do these studies compare? 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider both the range of a species and the climate change projections ...
\begin{enumerate}
\item Take each PEP725 datapoint within our selected species' range and calculate:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Min daily temp for 1-2 months before leafout
\item Max daily temp for 1-2 months before leafout
\item Most directly comparable to OSPREE would be daily min and max temperatures I think; might also be important to use daily min/max if we are focused so closely on getting things accurate. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item Other things to consider
\begin{enumerate}
\item Don't forget: you need the extremes to parameterize models (you need to know where the zeros are)
\item Thermal tolerances/limits (and where is the species optimum?) ...look at treatments beyond the variation seen within a species' range and see if there is abrupt change or you see continuous change, if no abrupt change then something else must limit range (e.g., biotic cues, minima temperature after which species)
\item Nacho's point about now that climate change is here we do need to focus on refining experiments to address what the cue impacts of climate change will really
\end{enumerate}
\item Paths forward
\begin{enumerate}
\item Manipulating one cue may be less useful esp. in comparisons with long-term data
\item Carefully select the cues you study and make your reasoning clear...
\item If you don't work within the range or projected cue range limits of a species, then be sure to work on informative extremes (I could use some help with this). 
\item Report all cues (even the ones you don't measure)
\end{enumerate}
\item Wrap-up....
\end{enumerate}
