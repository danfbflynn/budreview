GCB submission questions

>> What is the scientific question you are addressing?

49 words

Recent observations that long-term plant phenological responses to temperature appear non-linear with warming has led to growing interest in interactions between the cues that determine spring phenology. Here we ask when such interactions will lead to non-linearities with climate change, and whether we have the data to predict them. 


>> What is/are the key finding(s) that answers this question?

48 words

Harnessing the power of controlled environment experiments alongside long-term data could transform our fundamental understanding of phenology and advance forecasting. A meta-analysis of studies over the last seven decades shows the cue-space studied, how it compares to current and future conditions, and helps outline a cross-disciplinary path forward.


>> Why is this work important and timely?

49 words

Climate change has fueled growing interest in non-linear biological responses, with multiple papers attributing recent trends to interactive effects. Much of this work, however, is disconnected from fundamental plant biology. Using decades of controlled environment studies we show how and when responses will be non-linear because of phenological cues.


>> Does your paper fall within the scope of GCB; what biological AND global change aspects does it address?

47 words

We leverage research in fundamental plant development theory with recent findings from long-term records, commonly used to detect climate change impacts, to provide a path forward for forecasting shifts in phenology. We show how understanding interactive phenological cues will have implications for biodiversity, agriculture, and carbon storage.
