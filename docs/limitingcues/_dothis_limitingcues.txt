... I am reviewing the text, but I *skipped the abstract for now*

(1) Ask for help on new interactions figure

- From Ailene and Nacho, set up a git issue ...
	- Need help on this figure https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/ospree/blob/bbculdesac/docs/limitingcues/figures/limcues_intxns.png (pretty sure I have chill effect plot mislabelled, I think chilling goes up with warming in the code)
	- Ailene to help on analyses/limitingcues/nonlinearities_more.R

Relevant text from old version of ms:

- Alter non-linearity figure to include: "First, as discussed above, each cue alone may be non-linear when examined across a wide range of values. Cues may be linear in the mid-range of values, while extremely high or low values of some cues (e.g., photoperiod) may produce alternative response \citep{gauzere2017}. For example, at very low photoperiod (short days) plants often will not grow, similarly maximum growth may occur at photoperiods of 18 hours, meaning photoperiods longer than 18 hours will have no additional effect on budburst timing \citep{major1980}."

AND .... need a figure for this:
Given our current understanding of phenological cues, we should expect the most dramatic changes in phenology in systems with non-linear responses where climate change pushes the system across a critical threshold or inflection point. For example, if some species have a critical photoperiod for budburst and warming means forcing cues are met before the critical threshold, then we would expect incomplete or highly delayed budburst (needCITES). Similarly the complexity of chilling could produce myriad non-linearities. If, as currently hypothesized, chilling follows an optimum curve (i.e., chilling does not accumulate at very low or high temperatures but in between it accumulates at a maximum rate at some temperature optimum), then endodormancy break would shift earlier in systems where warming pushes winter temperatures into a chilling-accumulation temperature or closer to the optimum temperature, and delay where warming pushes winter temperatures beyond the optimum (with more complex predictions if high temperatures decrease accumulated chilling)

(2) Ask for help on other figures (see below section `Code in the paper')

(3) Do all the stuff mentioned in April and August 2020 notes below (ugh)

(4) Add new citations

studydesign_numcues.R -- probably the best way to count single and multiple cues and makes one of the plots
studydesignplots.R -- makes the heatmaps
countintxns.R -- counts interactions, which is a PAIN!
nonlinearities_intxns.R 
nonlinearities_more.R 

Also... for "PEP725 and NECTAR databases together have multi-site data on more than 2500 species"
goober <- read.csv("~/Documents/Subversion/phenology/Data/pheno_raw.csv")
unique(paste(goober$genus, goober$species))
unique(goober$site)

- I think best to figure out what figures I want and ask for coding help!
- I have done a good deal on issue 249 so time to just ask for help and get the paper moving! Move, move!

Figure about multiple cues over time:
	- Move to supp and make a new one with ...
	- # of studies over time; % that are one cue; % that are two or more?


8 Sep 2020 (updated 23 Sep 2020):
- Get the lab to help with some cleanup issues ... see https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/ospree/issues/249
	(1) Do these myself:
		Check that these should all truly be constant photoperiod (all exp 1: "cronje03" "devries82" "karlsson03")
		> unique(checkforcena$datasetID)
		[1] "ashby62"   "gansert02" "hawkins12" "ruesink98"
		> unique(checkphotona$datasetID)
		[1] "falusi96"    "gianfagna85" "manson91"    "nishimoto95"
	(2) Then figure out what to do about the chilling ones!
- update countixns.R 
	(1) Check the work here and update #s in paper (see note below)
	(2) Say something about material (seeds/saplings/cuttings)? Can we tie to relevance of predicting future forest communities or such?
- Need to clean up the heat maps, but can perhaps wait until we know what we want.


<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
April 2020 to do, working on it in August 2020
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

I have cleaned up the countinxns.R code ... am working on studydesignplots.R
(*) Fix heatmaps (old possibly useful idea? Get n of studies with n >= 2 cues of photo, temp, force (I think I mean interactive studies): one panel EACH for 1-2 field sample, and >2 field sample date)?
(*) Update the interaction #s (search for '% Need to update once below') -- CHECK WHOLE section! 
(*) Confirm color gradient with Nacho (should we add an obvious color bar legend?)
(*) FIX ME figure below ... do soon or start writing first?



In no particular order but need to be done...

(*) Add an average species number maybe to this text: our review of controlled environment studies found most studies focused on only one species with data on a total of 227 species
(*) Start on Rnw file for supp.
(*) Review issue on figures: https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/ospree/issues/174
(*) Cue or cue mechanism or what?

Cues is not a good term as we use it -- the environment does not CHANGE cues, does it? It changes the experienced cue ... or the response predicted at that level of the cue. We need to refine our language. ... Gauzere says cue for presence of a response (e.g., to photoperiod) ... they also use `compensatory effects of chilling on forcing requirements' ... as a way to subadditive I believe. They seem to describe the underlying curves as responses (e.g., `chilling and forcing responses') ... hmm, but they also say stuff like: "the effective response to day length simulated by the models can highly differ according to the adjusted reaction norms" so maybe response curve and reaction norm are interchangeable?

Salk 2020

"I focus mostly on what I call ‘cueing mechanisms’ (e.g. spring tempera- ture, chilling, photoperiod) rather than ‘cues’ (e.g. the specific critical photoperiod or degree-day requirement of a plant) as these are more likely to be a shared feature within a species. Because of its fundamental importance for carbon balance, especially in deciduous species (Dragoni et al. 2011), this paper focuses on leafing phenology in temperate and boreal trees."

Chmura et al. 2019 defines, "Cue: an attribute of the environment that initiates a phenological response" but their definitions are beyond that sort of sloppy (

Fix the text ...

Comments from Jan 2020 review ...

Overall it feels like there are 2 major threads in this paper…
1. Biology of interacting cues
2. The theoretical utility but current limitation of growth chamber studies to test these.

It feels like the set up of the paper is that we are going to talk mostly about number one, but the main take away feels like it is coming from part 2. *Lizzie says* I think it is supposed to be 'where we're at with limiting cues.' 

Ailene and Dan say add a figure for paragraph starting: These cues may create non-linear responses with warming in two major ways.

- Show correlations of GDD x Photoperiod at Harvard Forest?
- Dan and Ailene like Figure 8: Maybe on way to clean it up is to do lump all ambient+X studies as “ambient+” or remove the text one as “other” and and describe them in a supplemental table.

Citations work, notes etc.
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
NEED citations 

1. Studies using long-term data to try to tease out forcing and/or photoperiod and/or chilling cues *\cite{zohner2014}* Kramer et al. 2017 does it too (but with clones I think)
 
2. chilling varies by population and is higher at the coast *campbell1979*

4. warming increases the forcing plants experience each day: not great, but *skinner2018amplification* could work 

7.  For example, if some species have a critical photoperiod for budburst and warming means forcing cues are met before the critical threshold, then we would expect incomplete or highly delayed budburst 

13. Correlations between these predictors, however, are almost always too high for any useful analysis *NEED help*
