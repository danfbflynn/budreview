A few things remaining in PDF ...
- Ailene's interaction stuff
- Word count with numbered citations
- GDD x chill figure -- fix the x axis and explain the NA for photoperiod! 
Check on figure help:
- https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/ospree/issues/395
- https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/ospree/issues/393
- https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/ospree/issues/399
- ME: check countintxns for photo x temp and whether they are usually sub additive

(*) git issues 393-395, also issue 249) also ...

(*) Add new citations? There's a few in the folder. Also, add citations in depauperate areas

(*) Pick a journal!

(*) Small things to maybe do ...
- Say something about material (seeds/saplings/cuttings)? Can we tie to relevance of predicting future forest communities or such?
- Confirm color gradient with Nacho (should we add an obvious color bar legend?)
- Review issue on figures: https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/ospree/issues/174 (I read this in early Feb 2021 and I think we can close it soon; it does have some good info we may want top refer back to though in terms of how we made other figures)

Comments from Jan 2020 review ... we can trash these after the next review (if they don't re-appear):

Overall it feels like there are 2 major threads in this paper…
1. Biology of interacting cues
2. The theoretical utility but current limitation of growth chamber studies to test these.

It feels like the set up of the paper is that we are going to talk mostly about number one, but the main take away feels like it is coming from part 2. *Lizzie says* I think it is supposed to be 'where we're at with limiting cues.'

Emails on revisions ...

NACHO-specific, you wrote a few things about explaining details early on that I think we address in the 'Paths forward' section so I did not add details, but let me know if you still miss them and I can work on it. (Here's an example I am worried about not addressing, in the section 1.2 (How will chilling, forcing and photoperiod shift with climate change?)  where we write "We expect most non-linearities from climate change will come from the effects of interactive cues" you asked "perhaps this is said later, but could we mention that such refined understanding would involve, for example, having data on how responses change at finer/smaller cue steps (different to what is done in many experiments that look at a few, distant cue values)?")



Dear limiting cues co-authors,

BTW, in case you (like me) did not know -- you can combine comments in Adobe Acrobat. This is what I now do whenever I go to edit a manuscript and it's great! (Well, except for that fact that it tallies up all your comments so you see something like '129 comments.')

TITLE:
Limiting cues: How spring warming, winter chilling and daylength shape plant climate change responses
OR 
How interactive cues will shape climate change responses



What to move to supp?

2. (i)
3. i
4. iii 
5. iii 
6. i (i) or combine with 5 ... but Nacho votes to keep Fig 6

Going to supp! 
Fig 4 (the map)
Fig 5 (the studies over time)

Maybe start at these ...

(1) Nature Plants (https://www.nature.com/nplants/about/content also note about presubmission inquiries: . If your manuscript is already written please proceed with a full formal submission.) Review is 3000-4000 words with 4-6 figures and 100 citations

(2) GCB (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/13652486/homepage/forauthors.html) Research Reviews examine a defined specialist subject that is of topical interest. Reviews should begin with an abstract and an introduction, followed by up to 10 sections following a logically developed plan, and end with a Conclusion. Reviews should be no more than 8000 words (count includes Abstract, Introduction, body, Conclusions and Acknowledgements).

(3 or 4?) Journal of Experimental Botany (https://academic.oup.com/jxb/pages/what-does-jxb-publish) Review or Darwin review ... 6500 words

(3 or 4?) ELE -- did not check but pretty sure its 6-8K words


NEE -- identical to Nature Plants

New Phyt -- 3500-400K unless we got a Tansey (https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/14698137/about/author-guidelines#5 Short Research reviews should be in the range of 3,500–4,000 words, with up to 60 references and six figures/tables. Following a short introduction, putting the area into context, and providing a ‘way in’ for the non-specialist, these will concentrate on the most recent developments in the field. We also commission content, such as Commentaries, Meeting reports, Tansley reviews and Tansley insights. Enquiries or suggestions about these or other types of article are always welcome.) 


AFM (your article, your way but you still need highlights; https://www.elsevier.com/journals/agricultural-and-forest-meteorology/0168-1923/guide-for-authors)

Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment (https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/15409309/resources/author-guidelines-FEE#Reviews) Length: about 150 words for the abstract, 3000 words, not including a short abstract, not more than 35 references, and a total of 4/5 figures, tables, and/or panels

Ecological Modeling -- good if we end up in a cascade? (Also Elsevier, so also your article your way)

Also, for "PEP725 and NECTAR databases together have multi-site data on more than 2500 species" you can just run this:

unique(paste(goober$genus, goober$species))
unique(goober$site)

Should we call them cues or cue levels or ...?
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

As of Feb 2021, I sort of feel fine with how it is says Lizzie, see what co-authors say.

Previously I wrote ...
Cues is not a good term as we use it -- the environment does not CHANGE cues, does it? It changes the experienced cue ... or the response predicted at that level of the cue. We need to refine our language. ... Gauzere says cue for presence of a response (e.g., to photoperiod) ... they also use `compensatory effects of chilling on forcing requirements' ... as a way to subadditive I believe. They seem to describe the underlying curves as responses (e.g., `chilling and forcing responses') ... hmm, but they also say stuff like: "the effective response to day length simulated by the models can highly differ according to the adjusted reaction norms" so maybe response curve and reaction norm are interchangeable?

Salk 2020

"I focus mostly on what I call ‘cueing mechanisms’ (e.g. spring tempera- ture, chilling, photoperiod) rather than ‘cues’ (e.g. the specific critical photoperiod or degree-day requirement of a plant) as these are more likely to be a shared feature within a species. Because of its fundamental importance for carbon balance, especially in deciduous species (Dragoni et al. 2011), this paper focuses on leafing phenology in temperate and boreal trees."

Chmura et al. 2019 defines, "Cue: an attribute of the environment that initiates a phenological response" but their definitions are beyond that sort of sloppy (
