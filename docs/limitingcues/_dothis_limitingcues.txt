WORKING THROUGH PDF comments ... start at pg 6!


(*) Get help (git issues 393-395, also issue 249) also ...

(*) Add new citations? There's a few in the folder. Also, add citations in depauperate areas

(*) Pick a journal!

(*) Small things to maybe do ...
- Say something about material (seeds/saplings/cuttings)? Can we tie to relevance of predicting future forest communities or such?
- Confirm color gradient with Nacho (should we add an obvious color bar legend?)
- Review issue on figures: https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/ospree/issues/174 (I read this in early Feb 2021 and I think we can close it soon; it does have some good info we may want top refer back to though in terms of how we made other figures)


Comments from Jan 2020 review ... we can trash these after the next review (if they don't re-appear):

Overall it feels like there are 2 major threads in this paper…
1. Biology of interacting cues
2. The theoretical utility but current limitation of growth chamber studies to test these.

It feels like the set up of the paper is that we are going to talk mostly about number one, but the main take away feels like it is coming from part 2. *Lizzie says* I think it is supposed to be 'where we're at with limiting cues.'

(*) studydesign_numcues.R -- makes the number of cues x time figure.
(*) studydesignplots.R -- makes the heatmaps incl heatmapphotoxforcexchill.pdf and heatmapphotoxforcexfs.date.pdf *and* makes the latitude plots *AND* gets the cue diffs used in the PEP725 figure!
(*) countintxns.R -- counts interactions and labels interactive studies
(*) nonlinearities_intxns.R  -- code started to understand how interactions can create non-linearities (not currently used in ms)
(*) nonlinearities_more.R -- code to make non-linearity plots 
(*) models_stan_pepspp.R -- for gddbyutah_betpenfagsyl.pdf GDD by Utah plot (see also betpenexp.R in decsens repo and betpen_experiments.pdf)
(*) GDD_plottinglimcues.R does what it says!



Also, for "PEP725 and NECTAR databases together have multi-site data on more than 2500 species" you can just run this:
goober <- read.csv("~/Documents/Subversion/phenology/Data/pheno_raw.csv")
unique(paste(goober$genus, goober$species))
unique(goober$site)

Should we call them cues or cue levels or ...?
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

As of Feb 2021, I sort of feel fine with how it is says Lizzie, see what co-authors say.

Previously I wrote ...
Cues is not a good term as we use it -- the environment does not CHANGE cues, does it? It changes the experienced cue ... or the response predicted at that level of the cue. We need to refine our language. ... Gauzere says cue for presence of a response (e.g., to photoperiod) ... they also use `compensatory effects of chilling on forcing requirements' ... as a way to subadditive I believe. They seem to describe the underlying curves as responses (e.g., `chilling and forcing responses') ... hmm, but they also say stuff like: "the effective response to day length simulated by the models can highly differ according to the adjusted reaction norms" so maybe response curve and reaction norm are interchangeable?

Salk 2020

"I focus mostly on what I call ‘cueing mechanisms’ (e.g. spring tempera- ture, chilling, photoperiod) rather than ‘cues’ (e.g. the specific critical photoperiod or degree-day requirement of a plant) as these are more likely to be a shared feature within a species. Because of its fundamental importance for carbon balance, especially in deciduous species (Dragoni et al. 2011), this paper focuses on leafing phenology in temperate and boreal trees."

Chmura et al. 2019 defines, "Cue: an attribute of the environment that initiates a phenological response" but their definitions are beyond that sort of sloppy (
