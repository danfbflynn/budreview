\section*{Abstract}
Climate change causes both temporal and geographic shifts in species; these shifts affect the daylength (photoperiod) experienced. As photoperiod is a common trigger of seasonal biological responses (e.g., affecting plant phenology in 84\% of reviewed studies that manipulated photoperiod), shifts in experienced photoperiod may have important implications for future distributions and fitness. However, photoperiod has not been a focus of climate change forecasting to date, especially for early-season (`spring') events often assumed to be driven by temperature. We synthesize published studies to show that impacts on experienced photoperiod from temporal shifts could be orders of magnitude larger than from spatial shifts (e.g., 1.6 hours of change for expected temporal versus only one minute for latitudinal shifts). For woody plant phenology, for example, shifts in experienced photoperiod may increasingly constrain their ability to respond to additional warming. Incorporating these effects into forecasts is possible by leveraging existing experimental data; for example, growth chamber experiments on woody plant spring phenology often have data relevant for climate change impacts. We highlight how combining novel modeling approaches and empirical work on when, where, and how much photoperiod affects spring phenology could rapidly advance our understanding and predictions of future spatio-temporal shifts from climate change. %currently 200 words (the limit for reviews).

\section*{Introduction}
\par Photoperiod is a critical cue for the onset of spring in plants and animals, signaling changes in growth, migration, and reproduction across diverse species \citep[e.g.,][]{flynn2018,Howe:1996,lagercrantz2009,bradshaw2007,mcallan2006,solbakken1994,barker1976, farner1964}. Photoperiod is informative for migratory species,  because it reflects annual cycles across Earth, filtering out noise in local conditions that do not correlate with remote conditions of the destination \citep{winkler2014}. It is also a useful cue for nonmigratory species to synchronize activities with seasonal climatic changes \citep[e.g.,][]{Singh:2017, Basler:2012, Hsu:2011} because it is consistent across years, especially compared to other seasonal cues such as temperature and precipitation \citep{saikkonen2012}. For example, relying on a threshold photoperiod (see \emph{Glossary}), rather than temperature alone, may prevent woody plants from leafing out during ``false spring" events and experiencing frost damage \citep[unusually warm periods during winter that are followed by a return of cold temperatures,][] {Gu2008}. 

\par For many organisms, the timing of spring events---i.e., phenology, including flowering, bird arrival, egg hatching and myriad other biological activities--- is thought to be determined by photoperiod interactively with temperature \citep [][see also Box 1]{fu2019,winkler2014}. The strong role of temperature is apparent in recent advances in spring phenology, some of the most widely documented signals of climate change. At a given location on Earth, annual patterns in photoperiod have not changed as climates have warmed. Yet, across taxa, from plants and insects to mollusks and mammals, spring phenology is occurring earlier as temperatures warm, with average shifts of 1.2 to 5.1 days earlier per decade \citep{bradley1999,parmesan2003, poloczanska2013,root2003} or 1.3 to 5.6 days earlier per \degree C of warming \citep{polgar2013,Wolkovich:2012n}. These changes are some of the largest climate change-induced shifts observed, with early spring phenology shifting more rapidly than later season phenology in most cases \citep{bradley1999,menzel2006}. If photoperiod interacts with temperature to determine spring phenology, we might expect that, as current rapid warming continues, photoperiod should begin to curb trends in advancing spring phenology. 
\par Recent studies offer inconsistent views about whether photoperiod may eventually restrict advances in spring phenology in a warmer world. Some suggest that, with additional climate change, photoperiod will limit phenological shifts of certain species such that they will not track rising temperatures \citep{fu2015,way2015,Basler:2012,koerner2010a}. Instead, these species' responses will increasingly become constrained by daylength and the trend of ever-earlier springs with warming may halt. Other studies, however, suggest that photoperiod will not constrain responses to warming for most species \citep{chuine2010,zohner2016}. The extent to which daylength constrains phenology will depend in part on how rapidly photoperiod responses can acclimate or adapt to new environmental conditions, which remains poorly understood \citep{grevstad2015,bradshaw2007}.

\par Perhaps because of these variable and uncertain responses, photoperiod is often not included in forecasts of biological responses to climate change, especially in the spring, even though it is known to be an important cue for biological activity \citep[but see ][]{Caffarra:2011qf,duputie2015,grevstad2015}. The exclusion of photoperiod may be problematic: although photoperiod itself is stable over time, the photoperiod that species \emph{experience}, as they undergo climate change-induced shifts in space and time, is likely to be much less stable. In addition to shifting activity earlier with recent warming, many species have shifted their distributions poleward and upward in elevation \citep[i.e., range shifts,][]{chen2011,harsch2009,parmesan2006,penuelas2003}. These spatial and temporal shifts alter the photoperiod experienced by organisms (Fig. \ref{fig:spacetime}); altered photoperiods may have cascading effects on species' performance, since daylength can affect the timing of development \citep{grevstad2015,muir1994,tauber1975}, migration \citep{dawbin1966}, reproduction \citep{dunn2019,dardente2012,ben1997}, and other important responses. 

% Below paragraphed deleted because it seemed  out of place and unnecessarily complicated here. 
%When a population is moved to a new location with even a slight difference in climate, latitude, or seasonal timing, the genetically based photoperiod response is likely to be maladapted, leading to a life cycle that is asynchronous with resources or that includes too many or too few generations for the season duration (Danilevskii 1965). Models that ignore photoperiod responses in their forecasts are effectively assuming that the threshold photoperiod changes instantaneously with new conditions \citep{grevstad2015}. 
\par The implications of potential climate change-induced shifts in experienced photoperiod are unclear, as the magnitude of potential shifts has not been described. Effects of photoperiod shifts may be relatively minor, especially because there can be substantial year-to-year variation in experienced photoperiod (Fig. \ref{fig:greenup}). Alternatively, photoperiod may begin to constrain species' responses to climate change \citep{koerner2010b}.

\par Here, we ask: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item How will climate change alter the photoperiod experienced by organisms? 
\item What are the implications of altered photoperiods for biological responses to climate change?
\item Can researchers apply data from experiments that alter photoperiod to aid in forecasting biological implications of climate change?

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Focal examples from spring woody plant phenology}

\par These questions are broadly relevant for diverse species. Here, we use a case study of spring woody plant phenology to illustrate our points (Box 1). We focus on spring events, as phenology during this time is one of the most widely observed and rapidly changing biological responses to climate change \citep{parmesan2006}. In addition, the role of photoperiod is less well-understood in spring phenology compared with autumn phenophases, but recent studies showing declines in responses of spring budburst to warming \citep[e.g.][]{fu2019,gusewell2017,yu2010} suggest that photoperiod constraints may be imminent. Woody species are a useful focal group because they have been the subject of decades of growth chamber experiments, are at the center of an important and controversial debate on the relative effects of photoperiod versus temperature on their phenology, and because their phenology (i.e., the length of the growing season) has critical implications for global carbon cycling and feedbacks to the climate system \citep{richardson2013}. 
\par We use studies included in Observed Spring Phenology Responses in Experimental Environments (OSPREE), a new database of plant growth chamber studies that manipulate photoperiod and temperature to measure plant phenological responses, including budburst and flowering \citep{wolkovich2019}. The database includes studies that manipulate photoperiod (by applying treatments with different daylength durations, applying long-day versus short-day conditions for different lengths of time, and/or applying varying vs contant photoperiods) and temperature (by imposing different chilling and/or forcing treatments). The OSPREE database spans 201 woody plant species; all experiments in the database use dormant plant tissue (grown in greenhouses or taken directly from the field) exposed to experimental conditions \emph{\citep{wolkovich2019}} for which we could identify forcing, photoperiod, and chilling treatments quantitatively. See Supplemental Methods and \citet{wolkovich2019} for details. 



\section*{How will climate change alter the photoperiod experienced by organisms?}
\par Species experience different photoperiod regimes depending on their location on Earth (Fig. \ref{fig:spacetime}, \ref{fig:greenup}), the seasonal timing of their activity, and inter-annual variation in climate. The daylength experienced by plants on the date that spring ``green-up" occurs, for example, varies with latitude (Fig. \ref{fig:greenup}a). This is in part because latitudinal variation in green-up date, which occurs earlier toward the equator and later toward the north pole, is strongly driven by climatic differences that affect phenology, and in part because of latitudinal variation in photoperiod (e.g., at the north pole, the daylength at the summer solstice is 24 hours; see also Fig. \ref{fig:spacetime}). A general pattern of longer photoperiod at green-up toward the poles is consistent across years (Fig. \ref{fig:greenup}b) and green-up does not appear to occur at daylengths less than 10 hours. %HK: in what biomes?
There is strong spatiotemporal variation in experienced photoperiod across years (compare the photoperiod at green-up in ``early" versus ``late" years, Fig. \ref{fig:greenup}): experienced photoperiod at green-up can vary by two to three hours from one year to the next in the same location (Fig. \ref{fig:greenup}c). Though green-up date corresponds to plant phenology, we expect that spatiotemporal patterns of variation in spring phenology would be similar for other organisms \citep{ovaskainen2013, penuelas2002}.

\par Against this existing background variation, climate change will cause shifts in experienced photoperiod as species respond to warming temperatures. Spatial shifts in species' ranges and temporal shifts in phenology will alter the photoperiods experienced by organisms with future climate change. The magnitude of these alterations will vary depending on the organism's location and the type of shift(s) it undergoes. For example, poleward shifts in species' ranges cause organisms to experience a wider range of daylength throughout the year (Fig. \ref{fig:spacetime}). Elevational shifts, in contrast, cause minimal changes in the range of daylength throughout the year. %%IMC - do we have something to cite in support of this sentence? 
%AKE: I have not found a scientific publication yet- just back of the envelope calculations. for example, from https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/weather/ct-wea-0928-asktom-20160927-column.html: which states "Sunrise is one minute earlier for every 4,921.3 feet of height above sea level and one minute later for the same height. That is, two minutes of daylight are added for every 4,921.3 feet of altitude." 

\par To date, where the scientific literature has addressed shifts in photoperiod with climate change, the focus has been on how spatial range shifts will affect photoperiod \citep[e.g.,][]{saikkonen2012,way2015}. However, shifting phenology---especially the large changes seen in spring phenology---will also alter experienced photoperiod, because of the seasonal patterns of daylength (Fig. \ref{fig:spacetime}). 

\par Despite a focus on range shifts, current data suggest that temporal shifts will yield much larger changes in experienced photoperiod than latitudinal shifts (Fig. \ref{fig:spacetime}). %HK: but doesn't this also depend on your starting doy and latitude? for example below, why not use a woody plant species as you set up in your intro as your focal group and also refer to with your growth chamber studies below. AKE: This is true, but temporal shifts cause greater shifts in experienced photoperiod even close to the equinox, when differences in in daylength across days are the smallest. Left as is for now but could say this explicitly. 
For example, consider an insect that emerges from diapause or a tree that bursts its buds at latitude 45\degree, on average, around day of year 91 (April 2, when daylength is 12.8 hours). If the organism's phenology shifts 30 days earlier over the next century \citep[i.e., a rate of ~3 days per decade, as has been observed,][]{parmesan2003}, it will experience a daylength that is 1.6 hours shorter. This 1.6 hour decrease in daylength is equivalent to moving up 28.5\degree  in latitude on this day of year. However, if the same species shifts its range up in latitude 0.5\degree   \citep[i.e., 60 km over the next century,  comparable to observed rates,][]{chen2011,parmesan2003}, it will experience a daylength that differs by less than a minute on the same day of year. 

\par In many cases organisms may shift both their ranges and their phenology simultaneously \citep[i.e., due to new climatic conditions,][]{duputie2015,grevstad2015}. In addition, photoperiod sensitivity (see \emph{Glossary}) can vary with latitude, likely due to population-level differences in sensitivity \citep{gauzere2017,saikkonen2012,Caffarra:2011b,bradshaw2007,Vihera-Aarnio:2006aa,Partanen:2005aa,Howe:1996}.
With future climate change, it is unclear how these complexities will affect the photoperiod experienced by organisms and whether these shifts in photoperiod will have important implications for biological responses. This lack of clarity stems, in part, from the fact that phenology both affects and is affected by experienced photoperiod: climate change-induced shifts in phenology alter experienced photoperiod, which in turn affects phenology. 

\section*{What are the implications of altered photoperiods for biological responses to climate change?}
\par Daylength, often in combination with temperature, can play a role in controlling critical biological functions, including vegetative growth, cell elongation, budburst, and flowering in plants \citep{fu2019,Heide:2012aa,Heide:2011aa,Hsu:2011,sidaway2010,mimura2007,Linkosalo:2006aa,erwin1998,Ashby:1962aa} and growth rate, maturation, reproduction, migration, and diapause in animals \citep{dunn2019,winkler2014,zydlewski2014,dardente2012,tobin2008,bradshaw2006,ben1997,muir1994,saunders1970,dawbin1966}. Climate change-induced shifts in photoperiod are therefore likely to alter these functions. 
Indeed, growth chamber studies demonstrate that the magnitude of daylength shifts we can expect with climate change (i.e., 1-2 hours of difference in daylength with temporal shifts over the next century) are substantial enough to affect spring phenology in trees (Table S1). The direction and magnitude of responses will vary, however, because of variation in photoperiod sensitivity, and because photoperiod often interacts with other environmental drivers, such as temperature, to affect phenology (Box 1). 
\par The climate change-induced trend toward ever earlier springs means that experienced photoperiod may increasingly approach threshold photoperiod for many species, constraining their ability to respond to additional warming \citep{fu2019,vitasse2013,koerner2010b,Morin:2010aa,Nienstaedt:1966aa}. Interactions between photoperiod and temperature may therefore result in muted phenological shifts, compared to what would be expected based on temperature change alone \citep{koerner2010b,mimura2007,wareing1956}. If photoperiod does become limiting, the average trend of earlier phenology with warming \citep{ovaskainen2013,polgar2013,penuelas2002,menzel2000} may stop.


% 6 Dec 2018 (IMC): Not sure if this would make sense here, but we could talk about how the process of spatial-temporal shifts takes place by comparing populations of a species at the leading and trailing porgions of the range:
% If we think of a widely distributed species with e.g. 400km latitudinal range, equatorwards populations (trailing edge) will be experiencing stronger constraints by photoperiod, as warming will advance a lot the phenology, until reaching the photoperiod threshold below which survival is no longer possible.
% In poleward populations instead, although temperatures may be limiting, their interaction with increasing photoperiod may open an opportunity window for development.
% Obviously we don't need to expand on this, but maybe mention that the "detrimental/beneficial" effects of photoperiod*temperature interactions may differ across the range of a species.

 \par A challenge in understanding the implications of altered photoperiods under climate change, and for forcecasting whether and when the trend of earlier phenology with warming may slow or stop abruptly, is the wide range of observed photoperiod sensitivity across species \citep{flynn2018,Sanz-Perez:2009aa, zohner2016}, populations \citep{tanino2010}, and ecotypes \citep{Howe:1995aa}. How much genotype versus environment explain this variation is an active area of research \citep[e.g.,][]{franks2014,gould2010,mimura2010,frejaville2019}. Environmental conditions clearly play a role, since different combinations of ambient temperature and photoperiod may explain some of this variation, because temperature cues can override photoperiod requirements under certain conditions \citep [e.g.,][] {tanino2010}. In such cases, climate change-induced phenological shifts may occur at different rates than past shifts with warming. On the other hand, some of this variation may be due to underlying genetic differences, because photoperiod responses can be under strong genetic control \citep[][, see also Box 1]{bradshaw1995,keller2011,weih2004}. Teasing out the relative roles of genetics versus environmental conditions will be critical to accurate forecasts of future phenology under climate change.

\par Species- and population-level variation in photoperiod sensitivity may result in altered communities as climate change progresses. For example, a species or population that is relatively insensitive to photoperiod can take advantage of warmer springs by having an earlier start to its growing season. Indeed, phenological tracking of temperature (e.g., earlier flowering, leafout, migration with warming) has been linked with higher performance in plants and animals \citep{cleland2012,muir1994,willis2010}. Species or populations that are sensitive to temperature but relatively insensitive to photoperiod may therefore outcompete slower-growing or later-emerging ones that are limited by photoperiod and thus cannot take advantage of longer growing season conditions. To identify where, when, and how communities may be altered, quantifying species-specific photoperiod sensitivity and developing methods for incorporating photoperiod into forecasting future phenology are critical. 
\section*{Future directions: outstanding questions and incorporating photoperiod into forecasting}
\par  Incorporating photoperiod into forecasting is complex for a few major reasons. Future rates of phenological shifts are unlikely to be straightforward extrapolations from past and current rates. In addition, an organism's experienced photoperiod is both a driver and an effect of phenological shifts. 

\par Approaches for forecasting can be grouped into two broad categories: statistical models and process-based models. These two modelling paradigms differ in at least two ways, in terms of relating phenology to climate change. First, statistical models generally assume linear relationships between species' responses and environmental variables \citep[e.g., ][]{flynn2018,van2007,ibanez2010}; instead process-based models often incorporate nonlinear threshold relationships as well \citep[e.g.][]{chuine2001,morin2009,xie1989}. Second, statistical models of phenology under climate change have typically ignored photoperiod, focusing instead on seasonal or annual temperature \citep[e.g.][but see \citet{richardson2013}]{diez2012,ibanez2010,van2007}. % Or, as lizzie said: To date in statistical models many people either ignore photoperiod or they put it in in some very painful way ('we added photoperiod experienced on the day of budburst to the PEP725 data to test for the role of photoperiod') that is not well designed. 
whereas process-based models of phenology more frequently incorporate photoperiod, along with temperature \citep{duputie2015,morin2009,xie1989,zhao2013}. A challenge of process-based models is that they require detailed data that are often not readily available (e.g., daily climate data, nonlinear biological responses to fine-scale changes in temperature). Perhaps because of this challenge, statistical models remain more commonly used in climate change forecasts of biological responses \citep[e.g.,][]{Basler:2012,diez2012,garcia2016,ibanez2010,van2007,zhu2012}.

\par Future modelling can incorporate photoperiod by leveraging the large amount of experimental data on photoperiod responses (Fig. \ref{fig:photomap}, Table S1), especially when process-based approaches are used. Researchers can use these data to first learn whether the study species (or a phylogenetically closely related species) shows a photoperiod effect and, ideally, identify its threshold photoperiod and how it varies by population, ecotype, or other factors \citep{bradshaw2006,gwinner1996,tobin2008}. If there is evidence of a photoperiod response (e.g., \emph{Fagus grandifolia}, or \emph{Tilia americana} with low chilling in Fig. \ref {fig:photocurve}), daylength should be added to forecasting models, using the threshold photoperiod to define short-day and long-day conditions (Fig. \ref{fig:condiag}). Given the large change in experienced photoperiod with temporal shifts (Fig. \ref{fig:spacetime}), this may be particularly important for phenological forecasting. Since spatial shifts are associated with smaller changes in experienced photoperiod, it may be less important for distribution forecasts. Many species, however, may shift in \emph{both} space and time simultaneously. Thus, even though experienced photoperiod changes little as species distributions shift in space, phenology may be altered significantly.

\par For some species, experimental data can be immediately used in forecasting because experiments manipulate photoperiod at relevant scales \citep[e.g., ][Figs. \ref{fig:photomap}, \ref{fig:fagus} A, Table S1]{Basler:2014aa,Heide:2015aa}. For example, photoperiod treatments from growth chamber experiments with \emph{Fagus sylvatica} span the variation in both current and expected future ranges \citep[Fig. \ref{fig:fagus}A, ][]{duputie2015}, and may allow identification of threshold photoperiods (Fig. \ref{fig:condiag}). In other cases, attempting to incorporate photoperiod into forecasts of future phenology will reveal gaps in our understanding of many aspects of photoperiod responses. For example, photoperiod treatments from existing experiments of \emph{Quercus robur} do not accurately represent experienced photoperiods from current or future estimates (Fig. \ref{fig:fagus}B), making fine-scale projections difficult, even for this relatively well-studied species. This gap extends to many species, as most experiments manipulate photoperiod much more dramatically than will occur with climate change (Figs. \ref{fig:photomap}, \ref{fig:fagus}). Although these studies can be useful for understanding mechanistically how photoperiod responses work, extrapolating them to climate change models may not be reasonable. 
 

\par Photoperiod is not fully integrated into most current forecasts of biological responses to climate change \citep[but see][]{tobin2008}, an omission that could affect the accuracy of forecasts. Forecasts from ecosystem models often incorporate photoperiod, along with other variables such as evaporative demand and temperature \citep [e.g., the Ecosystem Demography model] []{jolly2005,medvigy2013}, but photoperiod is rarely included in species distribution models \citep [e.g.,] []{morin2009,zhu2012}. The sensitivity of model outcomes to assumptions made about experienced photoperiod and threshold responses to photoperiod needs further study, including understanding how variation in photoperiod responses across ecosystems, species, populations, and life stages impacts forecasts. We have focused here on spring phenology, but future work could also address the sensitivity of model outcomes to shifts experienced photoperiod at the end of the growing season (i.e., autumn phenology).

\par As researchers more fully integrate photoperiod into forecasting, a critical area of further study is understanding \emph{how} photoperiod acts as a cue. Photoperiod seems to interact with temperature to affect phenology \citep[e.g., ][]{zydlewski2014}; this would explain the divergent effects of photoperiod observed across studies in woody plants (e.g., Fig. \ref{fig:photocurve}). However, exactly how it interacts with temperature is not well-defined for most species or populations (Boxes 1, S1). For many species, additional experimental and physiological research is necessary, since the dormancy-breaking processes that photoperiod affects often require microscopy and detailed physiological approaches to observe \citep{hanninen2019, chuine2016}.  Understanding the drivers, as well as the consequences, of variations in photoperiod responses across species and populations will be particularly beneficial for forecasting. For example, what traits are associated with photoperiod sensitivity and does variation in photoperiod sensitivity or related traits have a strong genetic component? If so, are species or populations from some locations or lineages more likely than others to be constrained by photoperiod in their responses to climate change?

\section*{Conclusions}
Organisms may undergo large changes to the photoperiod they experience with climate change, even if they do not shift their ranges spatially. Here we have shown that these altered photoperiods may result in stalled future advances of woody plant phenology with warming (Table S1, Fig. \ref{fig:fagus}), with cascading effects on growth, fitness, and community composition due to the large variation in photoperiod responses across species and populations (Fig. \ref{fig:photocurve}). Shifts in photoperiod with climate change have implications for a variety of plant and animal responses, given that daylength affects critical activities for diverse species from insects \citep{bradshaw2006,linn1996} and salmon \citep{solbakken1994,taranger2003} to birds \citep{dawson2001} and marsupials \citep{mcallan2006,solbakken1994}. Given what we know, incorporating photoperiod into forecasting of climate change responses should improve model accuracy, and will illuminate additional experiments that could improve our mechanistic understanding of photoperiod as a critical cue for diverse biological responses.

\item \underline{budburst}: when one or more leaf buds have visible green tips. 
\item \underline{chilling}: the intensity and duration of winter temperature, often a certain sum of chilling that is  required \citep[e.g., some amount of hours or days of cold temperatures, defined by a specific critical temperature or range of temperatures, such as between 0 and 7.2 \degree C,][]{richardson1974}, that must be experienced for budburst to occur.
\item \underline{daylength}: the period of time during a 24-hour period during which an organism receives light.

%\item \underline{ecodormancy}: dormancy (e.g., halted or reduced growth) brought about by external conditions, such as cold temperatures or drought conditions, and during which individuals can break dormancy with appropropriate weather conditions, such as a warm spell. 
%\item \underline{endodormancyfit}: dormancy brought about by internal (rather than environmental) conditions, and during which individuals cannot break dormancy due to weather conditions, such as a warm spell. 
\item \underline{diapause}: period of suspended development or growth, usually used to describe invertebrates during unfavorable environmental conditions such as winter.
\item \underline{dormancy}: halted or reduced growth or activity, usually used to describe plants.
\item \underline{forcing}: warm spring temperatures, often a certain sum of forcing that is  required (e.g., some amount of hours or days above a specific temperature) for budburst or flowering can occur.
\item \underline{green-up}: The beginning of a new cycle of plant growth, usually evaluated at the landscape scale.
\item \underline{phenology}: the timing of life cycle events in organisms
\item \underline{photoperiod}: the daily duration of light (daylength) and dark to which an organism is exposed; often used synonymously with daylength.
\item \underline{photoperiod sensitivity}: the degree to which phenology is controlled by daylength; may be a nonlinear, or ``threshold", response in plants (Box S1) and animals \citep{tobin2008,grevstad2015}.
\item \underline{photoperiodism}: the ability to assess the length of day or night to regulate behavior, physiology, growth, development or reproduction.
\item \underline{threshold photoperiod}: length of day that causes an organism to switch from a short-- to a long--day response (or vice versa). For example, in European larch (\emph{Larix decidua}), budburst development may be constrained under short-day conditions, when daylengths are less than a threshold photoperiod of 10-11 hours \citep{migliavacca2008}. Above this threshold photoperiod, the long-day response of unconstrained budburst development can occur.

\section*{Box 1. Are photoperiod effects widespread? A case study of woody plant spring phenology}
Photoperiod responses are particularly well-studied in woody plant phenology. Decades of experimental growth chamber studies have shown that photoperiod is an important cue for spring budburst phenology in woody plants \citep[e.g.,][]{flynn2018,Basler:2014aa,Heide:1993a}. These experiments often manipulate photoperiod in combination with temperature to address basic questions about how these two environmental conditions act as biological cues. Temperature has a dual role in regulating woody plant phenology: chilling---the prolonged exposure to cold temperatures after growth cessation in the fall---is required to initiate budburst; and forcing---prolonged exposure to warm temperatures---is required for budburst to occur. Thus, chilling and forcing treatments are often altered in addition to photoperiod in growth chamber experiments \citep[e.g.,][]{Campbell:1975aa,Falusi:1990aa,HEIDE:1977aa,Laube:2014a,Spann:2004aa}. %Maybe briefly do the same thing for photoperiod- how is it usually manipulated?

\par Woody plant growth chamber studies have been conducted for decades, but have only recently been synthesized \citep{wolkovich2019}, revealing that photoperiod sensitivity is widespread, though with wide variation across studies and species. Growth chamber experiments in OSPREE suggest that the dominant photoperiod response in woody plant species is earlier and more rapid budburst with longer days \citep [e.g., ][]{Caffarra:2011a}. Thirty-one of the 85 studies in the OSPREE database included two or more different photoperiod treatments. Of these, 26 (84\%) found significant photoperiod main effects or significant interactive effects with temperature (i.e., photoperiod x temperature effects), across 176 species (Table S1). Main effects included responses such as growth \citep[e.g., higher growth rates with longer days][]{Ashby:1962aa} and reproduction \citep[e.g., increased flowering with longer days][]{Heide:2012aa}. 
%HK: It would be interesting to know how many were main effects vs. interactive. Seems like species with main effects would have more clearcut forecasting implications? Although even those with main effects may still have significant effects of temperature?

\par Growth chamber experiments highlight that responses to photoperiod vary depending on temperature conditions. For example, more rapid advancement of budburst was observed under long versus short days with low chilling, than with high chilling in \emph{Betula payrifera} \citep{Hawkins:2012} (Fig. \ref{fig:photocurve}). %HK: What's low vs. high chilling?
Frequently, long photoperiods can compensate for low amounts of chilling, resulting in enhanced cell growth \citep{Heide:1993,Myking:1995,Caffarra:2011b}.%or low forcing?
\par Woody plant growth chamber experiments also demonstrate that, though photoperiod responses are common, they are variable (Fig. \ref{fig:photocurve}). Responses to photoperiod differ by species \citep[e.g.,][]{Basler:2012, Basler:2014aa,flynn2018,Heide:1993a,Howe:1996,zohner2016}.
For example, with longer chilling treatments some species seem insensitive to daylength \citep[e.g., \emph{Hammamelis} spp., \emph{Prunus} spp.,][]{zohner2016}, % They don't specify the species they just say that 112 (out of the 173 species they studied) did not respond to varying photoperiods with low chilling treatments and then with increased chilling treatments, even more species were insensitive to photoperiod.  Intermediate chilling, only 16 species responded to photoperiod and, with high chilling, only 4 species responded to photoperiod (i.e., Fagus crenata, F. orientalis, F. sylvatica, and Carya cordiformis). From the figures in the supplement, I can offer a few species that have "no photoperiod requirement" according the Zohner/Renner... Hammamelis vernalis, H. japonica, most Prunus species including P. serotina, P. padus, P. avium, Betula pendula, Alnus incana, Acer platanoides, A. campestre... to name a few! Photoperiod requirement really varies across Betula and Alnus. 
whereas others (e.g. \emph{Fagus} spp., Fig. \ref{fig:fagus}A) seem to be highly sensitive to daylength, even with long chilling treatments \citep{zohner2016}. In addition, some species demonstrated a response to photoperiod opposite to that typically observed: \emph{Tilia}, for example, showed delayed budburst with longer daylengths \citep[Fig. \ref{fig:photocurve},][]{Ashby:1962aa}. %could also use heide93a for example: Long days reduced the thermal time to budburst in all flushing species except Sorbus acuparia and Rubus ideaus
Photoperiod sensitivity also varies by population and ecotype \citep[e.g.,][]{Partanen:2005aa} (Fig. \ref{fig:photocurve}). For example, photoperiod effects on budburst were more significant for lower latitude populations of \emph{Betula pendula} and \emph{B. pubescens} \citep{Partanen:2005aa}.

\caption{\textbf{Temporal shifts in activity yield larger changes in experienced photoperiod compared to spatial (latitudinal) shifts} on the same day of year, due to patterns in photoperiod variation with latitude and by day of year. Here, we show this variation at two latitudes (22.5\degree, 45\degree), using hypothetical spatial and temporal shifts. These shifts are based on observed rates with recent global warming: 6-17 kilometers per decade, or approximately 0.5-1.5 degrees in 100 years, for spatial shifts \citep{parmesan2003,parmesan2006}, and 2-3 days per decade, or 30 days in 100 years, for temporal shifts \citep{parmesan2006,chen2011}). They highlight the greater magnitude in daylength changes in the early spring, close to the vernal equinox (e.g., day of year 91), versus close to the summer solstice (e.g., day of year 182).}

Current approaches for forecasting spring phenology with climate change frequently rely on linear relationships between historical temperature data and observed dates of spring phenology (left panels). Adding responses to photoperiod, which commonly operate as threshold responses to short days (SD) versus long days (LD, see ``photoperiod sensitivity" in the \emph{Glossary}), will alter these forecasts (center panel) in ways that differ across species with divergent threshold photoperiods. Other factors that interact with photoperiod, such as population-level variation in photoperiod responses, can be incorporated into forecasts to further improve their accuracy (right panel).}
