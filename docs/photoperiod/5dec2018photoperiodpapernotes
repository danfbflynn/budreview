Comments on photoperiod paper

Add to Box:
- Dan sent a bunch of papers; a lot of overlap between flowering and leafing pathways and a lot 
- all aerial tissues sense light
- some papers said that photoperiod has nothing to do with budburst
- title: Dominant models of how photoperiod affects spring phenology
- some people believe that photoperiod affects 
add to intro (or somewhere else)
- spring leafout is generally thought to be controlled by 3 main cues
- less is known about budburst
- message could be that fundamentally we don't understand how photoperiod works in budburst
- these fundamental areas would help improve our
- write it long and then we will cut it back. 
- add phytochrome and light-sensing tissues
- start big- write it like a little mini paper
- photoperiod (or to glossary)
- note that studies include different daylengths, for different lengths, and/or varying vs contant. 
- deirdre was wondering "what is photoperiod?"

How will climate change alter the photoperiod experienced by organisms?
- rewrite first paragraph and shorten.
- most plants don't leafout before 10-12 hours photoperiod (nothing at 6-8 hours)
- when you get really far north, the daylength is 24 hours: make this point somewhere else (perhaps in population or species variation section )
- no constant photoperiod
- m

Figure 1 shows all the data their are- cite in Box 1. and anywhere there is a discussion of nonlinear or threshold response. This is a critical knowledge gap- these are all the data we have! also cite with species and population level variation. 

Figure 2: needs to be cited more. 10 hours and up seems to be the lower limit. 

Figure 3: Figure made sense with the text. Caption did not stand alone. add more from text to. Font could be bigger on insets, the differences. (Add magnitude to shift in legend). Temporal shift (30 days)

Nacho: add more about models about forecasting. include more about spatial models in forecasting. 

Throughout paper
- change "onset of dormancy" to budset
- change "break dormancy" in intro to "budburst"
- do not say that photoperiod breaks dormancy
- stay focused on budburst (don't say breaking dormancy)

-Overall comments
- start bigger (very little funnel currently)
- short paragraph at the start on animals and plants and photoperiod
- one of the biggest impacts we're seeing is spring phenology
- then narrow into spring wood phenology
- broaden again at the end

Future work: cite Figure 5. note species' biases, also cite in species differences. Add more to Figure 5 caption.  Also cite in Box (talk about the need for more different treatments. 24 hours is a useful) 
- Nature climate change is target. then GCB

Figure 6
Add "Feedback" or something similar to arrow.
at the last level we will use daily climate projections. make last panel
like to range forecast

move are photoperiod responses common in woody plants? to AFTER 
If one species has a really stronger photoperiod response and another doesn't- one will track and the other won't could lead to "phenological reassembly"" (don't say that!) (but can i cite ian's paper)

DONE Cut paragraph that starts with "Indeed" or make stronger. transition more gently into forecasting . perhaps move section about forecasting to beigning of Future directions section instead. 

End needs work!
