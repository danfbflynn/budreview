Notes on publication bias and using funnel plots to diagnose it in meta-analyses

Super useful overview of funnel plots for publication bias here:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/funnel-plot

Eco-papers about meta-analyses
- Gurevitch et al. 1992
- Gurevitch et al. 1999


Reviews of how much bias there is...
- Kicinski 2018

Reviews of how to deal with publication bias
- Lin et al. 2018
- Mueller et al. 2013
- Ioannidis & Trikalinos_2007 (most clearly shows funnel plots may not be so useful)

Papers on how to do a funnel plot:
- Sterne et al. 2011

Misc:
- Hamman et al. 2018, 'Bias in meta-analyses using Hedgesâ€™ d'


Relationships that fade with time ... (there are more of these in ecology I just cannot find them, may need to search more for 'declining effect')
- Jennions & Moller 2002
