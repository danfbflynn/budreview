\opening{Dear Dr. Sudgen:}
% Ailene -- can you add Fu 2015 (Nature) and the recent Richardson paper (SPRUCE, double-check but I think they claim to show photoperiod cannot be impt) as citations 5-6? (You can also switch from 'letter' class to article and then can use a ref manager). Also, should we add the Chuine paper instead of citing BOTH Korner and Basler pieces ... 
Please consider our paper, entitled ``XX'' for publication as a ``Report" in \emph{Science}. 
% The abstract has plenty of jargon so we might use the cover letter to show we can for the media/public also ... and we need a shorter letter. We also don't want to repeat the abstract too much  ... So edits below! 
The timing of spring phenology (e.g., budburst and leafout) in woody plants is critical to plant fitness, shapes plant and animal communities, and affects wide-ranging ecosystem services from crop productivity to carbon sequestration. % and feeds back to inform forecasts of future warming. 
Advances in budburst are some of the most reported---and tangible---biological impacts of climate change, garnering great research and public interest. 

\par As interest has grown, so has debate over which environmental cues determine spring phenology, with far-reaching implications for forecasts and current trends  (\emph{1-4}). While most temperate species show responses to spring warming (forcing), the prevalence and relative strengths of responses to chilling (associated with cool winter temperatures) and photoperiod (daylength) could slow or stall advances in spring phenology with continued warming. Indeed, recent work suggests chilling or daylength cues may underlie observed declines in the `temperature sensitivity' of leafout in Europe (\emph{5-6}). 
%\par The relative strength of these cues, which will determine how spring phenology shifts with future warming, is a source of controversy. Some research suggests photoperiod cues dominate in particular species or locations and are absent in others, whereas other research argues that winter temperatures (chilling) is critical and reductions in chilling caused by global warming are likely to have strong effects. Still other research highlights that all three cues may be important for the majority of species (\emph{5}). Reconciling these findings is challenging because studies employ divergent methodologies, across different species and locations, all of which may affect the strength of chilling, forcing, and photoperiod effects.

% We're too heavy on methods and light on resulst! So I tried to fix.
% Combining our meta-analytic approach with Bayesian hierarchical modelling allows use to extimate overall chilling, focing and photoperiod responses across 66 studies and 203 species, alongside species-specific estimates. .... To better understand how the model estimates relate to conditions in the real world, as opposed to experimental ones, we apply our model to well-studied locations in central Europe. Using simple forecasts of warming and historic climate and budburst data, we find that the impact of chilling and daylength cues is highly location-specific---dependent largely on whether chilling increases or decreases with warming. Thus, our results may serve to unify opposing sides of the controversy over phenological cues: while all species may respond to all cues in experimental conditions, the dominant impact of climate change appears to be from increased forcing in current environmental conditions. 
\par We address this controversy by synthesizing nearly four decades of controlled environment experiments to estimate overall chilling, forcing and photoperiod responses across 66 studies and 203 species from around the globe. We find most species respond strongly to all three cues, with chilling being the strongest cue (nearly four times greater than forcing). Yet, when we applied our results to areas with reported declining phenological responses to warming (\emph{5}), we find few sites where chilling or daylength cues would constrain leafout advances under current or near-term warming. Instead, we suggest observed declines may be due in part to a statistical artifact---we show that temperature sensitivities (measured in days per $^{\circ}$C) calculated without correcting for warmer daily temperatures will always predict a decline with warming---even with no change in chilling, forcing or photoperiod responses. % an artifact with wide-reaching implications for many areas of climate change plant biology. 
Our results thus resolve several major debates in plant phenology by showing that most species respond to all cues strongly in experimental conditions, but forcing appears to dominate responses to recent warming. % Thus, spring may continue to advance in many well-studied European regions in the future with the most dramatic changes coming from regions were winter warming causes dramatic decreases in chilling, with implications for ecosystem services related to phenology. 

\par Upon acceptance for publication, the database will be freely available at KNB (\emph{6}; currently meta-data are published there); the full database is available to reviewers and editors upon request. This work is a meta-analysis, so data underlying the work have been previously published; however, the compilation and synthesis of these data and the tables, figures, models, and materials presented in this manuscript have not been previously published nor are they under consideration for publication elsewhere.

Drs. T.J. Davies, S. Elmendorf and  J. Hille Ris Lambers have previously reviewed the manuscript. We recommend the following reviewers: .%Lizzie please add the list that you made at our retreat!
