Fig_bb concept_dormant


1a: Chilling treatments in field break plant endodormancy, after which forcing treatments are imposed by moving plant material to warmer temperatures that allow budburst to occur.

Transition should be fairly quick.

1b: Plants break endodormancy in field (after four snowflakes) and are fully ecodormant in controlled environment.

Transition should be fairly quick again and fully transition BEFORE controlled environment.

2a: Plants break endodormancy in chilling treatment (say, after three thermometers) and are fully ecodormant in forcing environment.

Transition should be fairly quick again and fully transition BEFORE forcing environment (i.e., red thermometers).

2b: chilling treatments may end before endodormancy is fully broken.

Transition should be SLOWEST and transition should end IN forcing environment (i.e., red thermometers), not before.
