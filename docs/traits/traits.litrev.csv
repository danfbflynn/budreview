bontemps17,DS,France,deciduous tree (Fagus sylvatica),budburst,"leaf area (LA), leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf water content (LWC), water use efficiency (WUE) estimated by carbon isotopic discrimination (d13C), twig Huber-value (HV: the stem cross-section divided by the leaf area distal to the stem), wood density (WDens), and leaf nitrogen content (Nmass).","individuals with early leaf unfolding had leaf traits allowing water uptake i.e. low water use efficiency, low leaf mass per area and high water content, which is expected to maximise the carbon acquisition through longer effective growing season, jointly with a maximal use of early spring rainfalls before summer drought. Conversely, individuals with late leaf unfolding also had leaf traits limiting water stress i.e. high water use efficiency, high leaf mass per area and low water content, which is expected to optimize the use of available water resources and would allow coping with the strong summer droughts."

dorji13,CC,Tibetan plateau,alpine species,reproductive phenology,rooting depth,"Not very relevant. study looks at the effects of warming and snow cover on flowering phenology on alpine species. Shallow-rooted, early-flowering species responded poorly to warming but responded better to snow addition in terms of reproductive success"

Common garden study spanning latitudinal gradient in the Rockies. Finds strong genetic signal for budset but not budburst. Look at height and dbh, trees were biggest when growing slightly north of their provenance location. Southern, taller trees ceased growth later in the season"
