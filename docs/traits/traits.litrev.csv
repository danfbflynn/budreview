Conversely, individuals with late leaf unfolding also had leaf traits limiting water stress i.e. high water use efficiency, high leaf mass per area and low water content, which is expected to optimize the use of available water resources and would allow coping with the strong summer droughts."chai15,DS,China,deciduous tree (Quercus aliena var.acutiserrata) and Evergreen (Quercus spinosa),evergreen and deciduous within species trait differences across elevations,"specific leaf area (SLA), photosynthetic capacity (Pmax), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), and leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations (LN and LP) leaf length (L), width (W), perimeter (Pe), and circularity (Cir), leaf carbon (C), soluble saccharide (SS) and starch (S), lignin (Lig) and cellulose (Cel), polyphenol (PolP) and tannin (T) concentrations,  ash (A), heat of combustion (HC), leaf construction cost (CC), photosynthetic N-use efficiency (PNUE), content of chlorophyll.",Not a relevant paper for us but helpful to understand trait variation and what environmental factors cause themchelli19,CC,Italy,"vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens",,all traits,not relevant paper for us - looking at the effects of human impact on functional traits including flowering phenology.
