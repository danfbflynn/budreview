Notes on working on question of which authors publish together, including:
(a) Getting bibtex file into usable author data!
(b) Gephi stuff

<><><>
Note!
<><><>
That this is all a bit of a pain, if you’re just adding a reference or two, best to just add them to ospreebib.csv by hand, then re-build aut.sm.csv (from authors.R). 


<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
Getting bibtex file into usable author data!
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

(1) Use jabref** to go from bibtex to a csv file 
Export the bibtex file into an openoffice/libreoffice csv file

(2) Manually do some cleanup (most things end up in the right column, but some years and keywords get mis-placed); I just have to manually clean it up. Most of the issues come from the authors getting placed in multiple cells, so I paste them back into one cell.

At this point I also did the following:
- removed all {\ { } “ ‘ from the authors field
- changed Hanninen, Heikki and Hanninen, Risto to always be HanninenH, Heikki and HanninenR, Risto. It’s not pretty but it works!
- DF manually changed resulting file in one instance, castro-d\iez to castro-diez. Changed ref/aut.sm.csv.

(3) I then grab the authors column, paste it into an empty TXT and re-read it into Excel, asking for the delimiters of & and semicolon (I could do this in R). I add the resulting new seven columns and name them aut1 … aut7.

(4) Ugh, that was messy. Now to R … 

**Problems with installing a working version of jabref:
Solved here: https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/1481

Gephi!
<><><><><><>

After much ridiculous effort to get the authors names into the format:
name1, name2, freq (aka, how many times there published together)

I could then just follow along here (see full code at bottom of page):
http://www.vesnam.com/Rblog/viznets2/

I wrote out both file versions …
I am pretty sure both the size of color of the circle display the betweeness in the current figures (because I manually changed this in Gephi), but I believe the automatic opening of gexf file in Gephi gives you the color being degree and the size being betweeness.

Degree is: The degree of a vertex is its most basic structural property, the number of its adjacent edges. 

Betweenness is: The vertex and edge betweenness are (roughly) defined by the number of geodesics (shortest paths) going through a vertex or an edge.  (More here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality)

Note that I used forceatlas and nooverlap to help with visualization and I added the node labels.

DF: To make PDF of these, I tried to open .gexf files using gephi https://gephi.org/users/download/ but failed… Edge lengths are zero?

Now, back to categories!
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
For now (14 January 2017) I made categories based on labgroups.pdf. I did this visually by hand and saved it in aut.names.categorized.csv. I only listed the names that were part of clusters with 9 or more names.

As I did it by hand, we should check my work. Here’s the totals I think we should have (okay as of 2 Feb 2017, see authors_backconvert.R):

chuinejones	10heide		17hanninenh	24herter		10cookcronje	9bonhomme	9

Updating work on 20 April 2017
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

So, somewhere along the way I discovered that not all the authors matched up when you went to merge my lab group creations back into OSPREE. I tracked down a couple issues, including:

(a) The datasetID codes were missing for a couple entries in the ospree.bib so I added them.
(b) Some datasets were dropped when I asked for all possible combinations. This doesn’t matter because these were sole author papers by people part of no major group.
(c) Nonetheless I updated lots of the code and ran the Gephi analysis again, but I did not update the categorizations (i.e., the work in ‘Now, back to categories!’ above). A quick comparison of the labgroups.pdf from the 18 Jan 2017 commit (f9eb0b30bb537177956a022476452b7c71f1e684) and my new commit (on 20 April 2017, 072ab7a3077e05b0f23f3af5c48d48f5988b464c) suggests no big differences. 

… Because I don’t think we can use the lab groups info in a hierarchical model! If we do want to use though we should check what changed with all my work just now and double-check the work.

Notes on merging in labgroups
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

Note that you do need to adjust two names for matching to the main database currently:
bb$datasetID[bb$datasetID=="Sanz-Perez09"] <- "sanzperez10"
bb$datasetID[bb$datasetID=="Heide03"] <- "heide03"

And currently how many rows per lab group? 

table(bb.wlab$cat)
   bonhomme chuinejones  cookcronje   hanninenh       heide      herter       other 
         46         110         132         321        2200         23        1223 

quick calculations of datsetIDs:
bonhomme:	1
chuinejones:	4
cookcronje: 	2
hanninenh: 	10 
heide:		14
herter:		1
other: 		26
