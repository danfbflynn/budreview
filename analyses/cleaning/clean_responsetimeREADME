This is a readme for the clean_responsetime.R file
Built by Dan B, On April 24 2017 to recap response_time cleaning
**indicated should be fixed elsewhere


<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>
START Lizzie’s queries:

Can we change “this is fine” to “this is fine: do not change” or “this is correct, do not change” or such?

Lines 85-91: If any entry is okay, can we again make the ‘ok’ longer and more explanatory (see options above)?

END Lizzie’s queries.

_______________________________________
respose=1,Negative values in response time: check if these are fixed in later code
"caffarra11b"-fixed (was blank in paper) 
"calme94"-fixed (negative, fixed)  
"heide12"-fixed (paper says response > 90 days, we re-coded as no response)     
"heide93a"-fixed (paper says response > 50 days, we re-coded as no response) 
"howe95"-fixed (paper says response > 60 days, we re-coded as no response) 
---------------------------------------
1 in response, but resp.varsimple is in %budbust
**falusi96- For data from table 2, change to mean days to reach phenostage 3 (fix in clean_responsetime.R wherever it first shows up as an issue)
ruesink98"- OK
-------------------------------------------
Are 1 in response, but other in respvar.simple 
**cannell83- would need to fix this is respvar by calculating thermal time from figure 3 (check clean_thermaltimetodays.R) 
**gunderson12- in clean_bbperctodays.R extract budstage 3. In paper: "at 3, buds were just open and leaf tips were beginning to emerge") (check clean_thermaltimetodays.R) 
"heide11"-OK
"pettersen71"-OK
"sonsteby13" -OK
-------------------------------------------
 Entries that are time but are not in response.time
*ashby62-fixed but other problems, it seem Betula and Quercus entries are misplaced
#basler12-ok
#boyer-ok
#caffara11b-ok
#laube14b- fixed
#skuterud94-figure 4 entries ok, figure 5 entries fixed
#zohner16-ok

**falusi90- respose is actually % budburst (fix in clean_responsetime.R wherever it first shows up as an issue)
**ghelardini10-cat says this is fine, see her for details ask lizzie about this (check clean_thermaltimetodays.R) 
heide12-fixed
**heide93-cat says this is fine, see her for details ask lizzie about this (check clean_thermaltimetodays.R)

Overall, I checked 0.377624 rows of the full dataset.
Dataset ID's that still need attention:
falusi96
cannell83
gunderson12
ashby62
falusi90
ghelardini10?
heide93?
