# In July 2017 we realized we left year off the Zonher data, but we need it!
# So weâ€™re adding it in here, it should be year of experiment, which is 2014.

# Falusi97 is difficult, the data on X axis in Fig 1 is TRANSFER date, but
# you cannot tell how long they measured them for. Based on my reading I am 90% sure
# Fig 1 shows values at the end of 120 d (see main text below fig and note exp 2 was
# all 60 d) so correcting that here. I still would be cautious of using these data as
# text below fig 1 also refers to 'last chilling cutoff date (December 24)' but it is
# not possible to figure what chilling was (perhaps 'nursery' was outside?)

#pop2000 (Dan) is wrong on many levels.
# 1) resp.var is actually percenttwigswithbudburst 
# 2) response.time is actually chilling time
# I'm making those changes here, and also deleting the study from anaylsis in clean resp_varmore.R just incase it slips through
