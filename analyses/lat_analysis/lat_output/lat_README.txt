1. listofstudies.csv
	This .csv file is a list of all the studies that manipulated provenance location and also 	manipulated photoperiod. This list was condensed to include only European studies and only 	studies that look at days to budburst with multiple provenance locations and multiple 	photoperiods for each study.
	
	datasetID: study name and code from original ospree dataset
	genus: genus of the species in that study
	species: species name
	provenance.lat: provenance latitude of where the samples were collected
	provenance.long: provenance longitude of where the samples were collected
	prov: number of different provenance.lats per study
	sample: number of different field sample dates per study
	force: number of different forcing temperatures manipulated per study
	photo: number of different photoperiod treatments manipulated per study
	chill: number of different chilling treatments manipulated per study
	spp: number of species assessed by study
