Conclusions of photoperiod with multi late papers. for Dan and Cat's subproject..

Falusi96-- Long photo period aided budburst for northern population only when chilling requirement wasn't fully met.
Ashby 62-- Full chilling nullified bud burst, Long day delayed budburst in insufficiently chilled invidivuals. Didn't really report, but didnt seem there was a regional effect.
Basler 12-- abies, quercus and picea had a regional difference in photoperiod cue strength.
Hawkins 12-- Photoperiod cues were stronger in insufficiently chilled individuals. There was not difference in photoperiod effect between provinance, but effect was weak in general.
Heide 08--found temperature by photoperiod interation, but werent really interested in latitude of orgin

Heide 93A- This is good, found photoperiod partially compensates for chilling, but no difference amoung ecotypes.
Myking95- Chilling requirement decrease with increasing latitude. photoperiod only effect budburst with insufficient chilling. In betula pubescens, photoperiod strength depended on ecotype.
Niendstadt1966_ all spruces- photoperiod compesates for lack of chilling. southern require less chilling.- didnt mention latitidinal difference.
Partenan 2001- Do not use, sampling location covaries with age of sample
Skutrand94-didnt maipulate photoperiod
Vario-Arenio2006- used different photoperiod treatments fpr different ecoypes.
