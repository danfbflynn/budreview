## Dan and Cat have been interested in the seemingly conflicting hypothesis about the interaction between latitude and photoperiod sensitivities
## 14 March 2018
# Cat started a literature review to see what the results indicate. She started by subsetting the main data frame from OSPREE down to studies that manipulated photoperiod lengths and provenance latitude.


### ashby62 - results - may indicate more responsive to latitude in terms of growth...

## basler12: different species are either photoperiod sensitive or not - 
  # Hypoth - late successional species are photoperiod sensitive
  # No strong relationship between photoperiod sensitivity across lats

# falusi96: different provenances will respond differently to photoperiod lengths
  # Findings: most responsive to chilling but photoperiod x chilling could advance budburst

## hawkins12: different provenances will respond differently to cues
  # Findings: not strong for photoperiod alone, but when coupled with chilling or forcing
    # then can play a role

## heide05: photoperiod does not play a role in dormancy or growth in apples or pears - confirmed

## heide08: photoperiod not a driver when sufficient chilling and forcing, more of a driver in interaction

## heide12: higher latitude required fewer high photoperiod days

## heide93a: results - long days reduced thermal time for most species except for Sorbus and Rubus

## howe95: results- higher latitude individuals required longer photoperiods and greater sensitivity

## myking95: results - chilling was the most important but photoperiod was important when not enough chilling
  ## no latitude change

## nienstaedt66: results - chilling was the most important, but photoperiod could compensate for chilling
  ## no latitude change

## partanen01: results - chilling was the most important, but photoperiod could compensate for chilling
  ## no latitude change

## partanen04: species form photoperiodic ecotypes - studies critical night lengths, northern species require
  ## shorter CNLs for budburst

## partanen98: no real latitudinal hypothesis or results

## schnabel87: no real latitudinal hypothesis or results

## skuterud94: no real latitudinal hypothesis or results

## viheraaarnio06: CNL and ecotypes across latitude - higher latitudes may be more sensitive to light quality

## worrall67:  no strong effect of photoperiod

## zohner2016: lower latitudes required longer photoperiods - contrary to most other literature

###### Non OSPREE papers that discuss this topic ######

## High Latitude Hypothesis - Saikkonen2012 "However, native species may still retain a competitive edge because they are adapted to strictly track the photoperiodic cues at that latitude, which remain the same."

## Gauzere2017: Lower lat require photoperiod x forcing to overcome lack of chilling and photosensitivity may
  ## be more important at the cold trailing edge in order for range expansion

## Way & Montgomory 2015: all species will rely on photoperiod cues as winter and springs warm

## Caffarra2011: more northern species responded more to photoperiod cues than southern populations
