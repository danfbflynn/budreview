Osada2018,Cat,all three,"just looking at Fagus crenata in Japan but across 7 sites and 9 deg latitude. Day of budburst was earlier from more northern populations, forcing was lower for more northern populations. Chilling was strongly correlated to origin, with more chilling, less GDDs required. Longer photoperiods for more northern populations and more southern populations had more variability in photoperiod"
Morin2008,Cat,all three using Phenofit,Look at 16 European tree species and their ranges. Find local exctinctions at southern end of species ranges due to flower frost damage and drought mortality but increased expansion northward under A2 and B2. More extinctions under A2 but overall slower rate of extinction than previously predicted
Liang2019,Cat,"all three - chilling for dormancy break, forcing for budbreak, and photoperiod for autumn senescence ","Common gardent experiment with Fraxinus americana, looking at interannual climate variability for budburst and latitudinal gradients for budset. They found that budset timing more strongly related to provenance latitude but also found that individuals from more northern populations required a stronger chilling cue and less of a forcing cue"
Kramer2017,Cat,Chilling and forcing,Find that Fagus sylvatica has a flexible phenology in relation to temperature shifts. 
Brown et al 2016,Darwin,Forcing,This is a meta-analysis of phenology data on range limits and phenology for fishes!
Chuine et al 1999,Darwin,Forcing and Chilling ,"Looked at 4 species: Platanus acerifolia, Quercus pubescens, Castanea sativa and Vitis Vinifera. Found species were very well adapted to their own geographical area despite moving plants to different regions. "
Chunie 2010,Darwin,None,This paper is more of a review of phenology with no actual data collected or shown 
Clark et al 2014,Darwin,Forcing,Focusses more on model comparison but does show that warming at range limits tends to increase budburst and leafout
Muffler et al.,Deidre,False spring,"Looked at frost damage after late spring frost, 170 spp in a Botanical garden in Germany, found frost damage was lower for species from high latitude populations, additional variation was explained by phylogeny and phenology"
Doi et al 2008,Deidre,fall temps,"Looked at fall colouring and leaf fall for Ginkgo and one acer sp in Japan, focus is on latitude, leaf colouring/fall occurred earlier at higher latitudes, driven just fall temperatures"
Ford 2001,Deidre,"fall temps, photoperiod ","Looking at the end of diameter growth in the fall in response to temperature and shortening daylengths. Found both cooler temps and shorter photoperiods interacted to determine the timing of cessation in Douglas fir, trees from regions with more frequent frosts and winter stopped growth sooner. "
Guilbault 2012,Deidre,chiling,"Focused on Russian olvie in NA, for budburst portion (also looked at seed germ) had 12 chilling treatments, & compared sapling to adult cuttings. Concluded that winter chilling requirments determines the southern range limit of this invasive species. Adult cuttings needed longer than seedling. "
Pither,Dan,"not phenology, but uses Little distrubution maps","Tests 3 hypotheses: Range size as driven by climate extremes, climate variability, and climate means,  and find climate extreme (hiest temps and lowest Jan temps) is best predictor of range size, cite chuine that northern species are excluded from south range due to lack of chilling"
Kreyling,Dan,cold tollerance: could the strong response to photoperiod and cold drive cold hardiness?,"A strong correlation between minimum photoperiod and maximum hardiness, as well as between the rate of change of photoperiod and hardening, indicates that not only maximum cold tolerance, but also speed and timing,High temporal or spatial het-
erogeneity in temperature across the species’ native ranges

resulted in superior cold tolerance."
Saikkonen,Dan,photoperiod,"phenology of many plants is regu
lated by changes in day length, particularly north and south of the

tropics of Cancer and Capricorn."
