JoinModel_Stan_readme

This is a description of teh different stan files in the /ospree/analyses/jointmodel/stan folder

- forcingOnlyModel.stan
This model was part of the process Faith went in building a joint model. it focusing only on foring and a singel trait value per species to predict phenology day of year event.


- joint1TraitForcing.stan
This is a full joint model with a singel trait and just forcing. It includes a grand mean on the trait values, but the priors are not biologically relevant. 

- jointtraitphen.stan
First pass at a joint model to best estimate species-level trait values
and use that to predict phenoloy, by Lizzie with help from Faith and Geoff 

- jointtraitphen_ncp.stan
an old attempt at pon centred parameterisation of jointtraitphen.stan

- jointtrait_traitmodel.stan
and old attempt at a joint model.  BAsed off Lizzie's joint model exqation. By Faith Jones, extracted from JointModelSim_fj.R on 21 Feb 2020 by Lizzie 

- jointtrait_traitmodel_ncp.stan
Running a joint model to try and see how trait variation might help predict phenology. BAsed off Lizzie's joint model exqation. By Faith Jones, extracted from JointModelSim_fj.R on 21 Feb 2020 by Lizzie 

- jointtrait_traitmodel_vectorized.stan
An old attempt at vectorization to make teh code faster 

- OneTraitOnlyModel.stan
Based on Faith's second attempt at making a joint model with 1 trait and 1 phenology influence(forcing). Model based on stan_Part1.stan writen by Faith in Feb 2020, but split from that model Dec 2020 because Faith wanted to try a grand alpha it should get species specific trait effect values 

- stan_joint.stan
Faith's second attempt at making a joint model with 1 trait and 1 phenology influence(forcing). It doesnt have bioloigically relevant priosrs. 

- stan_joint_newPriors.stan
Geoff sent Faith some simulation code to try, but without a grand mean, so this the code with priors relating to that simulation.  

- stan_Part1.stan 
The trait half of stan_joint.stan

- stan_Part2.stan 
The phenology half of stan_joint.stan
