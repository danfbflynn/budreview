Dan's menthods for making the photo period curves (June 27 2018)

Methods:
Using Cat's table X, I selected all the publications that had 3 or more photoperiod treatments. I than examined each of these papers, and identified only three that used 3 or more photoperiod treatments in the same experiment:  heide93a,ashby62 andcafarra11b.
I subsetted the data from each publication to the relevant experiment only and combined these into a single data sheet. I plotted the response (days to budburst as a function of the photoperiod treatment. Chilling and species considerably between the response. I catagorized the chilling levels into None, Low, Medium, High as follows:
<31 Chill Portion= no chill
31-80= low chill
81-130<-Medium chill
>130=High

Line types are assigned to species. Additionally, each unique set of predictors (populationXchilling) is grouped by a factor called "thingy". Though not depicted in the map, it importantly indetifies each treament.
All forcing was at 22 or 21 so it is not included in the map.

More details to follow as I work on this.
