Methods \& Caption for Phenofit figures:

Methods:
We took current budburst data (1981-2000) and model projection budburst (2081-2100) using the A1Fi Phenofit scenario for two species -- \textit{Fagus sylvatica} and \textit{Quercus robur} -- and compared these points to data obtained from the OSPREE dataset. The OSPREE data points were collected from experiments and days of budburst were calculated from the start of the experiment, rather than from the start of the year. In order to render these points comparable to the current observations and the model projections, we scaled the days to budburst by adding the day of budburst from the first Phenofit observation to all of the OSPREE data points. We only used Phenofit data that had both current and projection data. 

Caption:
A comparison of how experimental treatments of daylength varies by latitude (A) and by day of budburst (B) as compared to current and projected daylength for [\textit{Fagus sylvatica} or \textit{Quercus robur}]. In panel (B) for \textit{Fagus grandifolia}, we explored the 15 OSPREE data points that have later days to budburst times than the current or projected days to budburst. The majority of those points had 5-8 hours shorter photoperiods than is biologically possible and the last few points had little or no experimental chilling.
