#Make a table of studies that manipulated photoperiod and provenance latitude
studies<-c("ashby62","")
### ashby62 - results - may indicate more responsive to latitude in terms of growth...

## basler12: different species are either photoperiod sensitive or not - 
# Hypoth - late successional species are photoperiod sensitive
# No strong relationship between photoperiod sensitivity across lats

# falusi96: different provenances will respond differently to photoperiod lengths
# Findings: most responsive to chilling but photoperiod x chilling could advance budburst

## hawkins12: different provenances will respond differently to cues
# Findings: not strong for photoperiod alone, but when coupled with chilling or forcing
# then can play a role

## heide05: photoperiod does not play a role in dormancy or growth in apples or pears - confirmed

## heide08: photoperiod not a driver when sufficient chilling and forcing, more of a driver in interaction

## heide12: higher latitude required fewer high photoperiod days

## heide93a: results - long days reduced thermal time for most species except for Sorbus and Rubus

## howe95: results- higher latitude individuals required longer photoperiods and greater sensitivity

## myking95: results - chilling was the most important but photoperiod was important when not enough chilling
## no latitude change

## nienstaedt66: results - chilling was the most important, but photoperiod could compensate for chilling
## no latitude change

## partanen01: results - chilling was the most important, but photoperiod could compensate for chilling
## no latitude change

## partanen04: species form photoperiodic ecotypes - studies critical night lengths, northern species require
## shorter CNLs for budburst

## partanen98: no real latitudinal hypothesis or results

## schnabel87: no real latitudinal hypothesis or results

## skuterud94: no real latitudinal hypothesis or results

## viheraaarnio06: CNL and ecotypes across latitude - higher latitudes may be more sensitive to light quality

## worrall67:  no strong effect of photoperiod

## zohner2016: lower latitudes required longer photoperiods - contrary to most other literature
