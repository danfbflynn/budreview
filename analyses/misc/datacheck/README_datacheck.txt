Started 1 April 2020

Started a week before 1 Apr 2020 to cross-check our newly entered data (new papers we entered in summer 2019 through fall 2019) for whether it makes sense, things to watch out for (it's all crops or the experiment seems odd) and whether it was all entered correctly.

datacheck_assign.csv is a list of those new papers (by datasetID) with people assigned in groups to review them.

Updated
21 Apr 2020

New groups assigned (see datacheck_assign.csv, round 2), and each group has two SEPARATE groupings of data to review. Please review the set under round 2 for your team and separately analyze set 2.
