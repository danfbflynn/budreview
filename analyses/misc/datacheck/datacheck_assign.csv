richardson18,CC and DS,NA,yes,no,ambient forcing and chilling but no field sample date so data lost in climate data conversion
flynn18,FJ and DB,,,,
fu19,GL and IMC,,,,
fu18,DL and MG and AK,no,yes,no,"will need to pull climate data to calculate forcing, chilling, and photoperiod (all ambient plus XXC)"
man17,CC and DS,NA,yes,yes,not able to include. Response variable is cumulative chilling
malyshev18,FJ and DB,,,,
anzanello16,GL and IMC,,,,
anzanello18,DL and MG and AK,no,yes,no,chilling entered incorrectly - not calculating to Utah Chill Units. Only 1 out of 10 replicates in bb datasheet. 
nanninga17,CC and DS,NA,yes,no,missing data from experiment 1. Something is happening with chilling code. This needs to be fixed.
