Studies with multiple chilling temperatures (but not necessarily varied by day/night):

Studies (only 8!) that have different day and night temps (... only Myking 97 seems to have crossed night and daytime temperatures):

> subset(osp.daynight.vary, numdiffforce>0)
    datasetID study          treatinfo numconstantforce numdiffforce

Potentially useful, here are all the studies (27) that manipulated forcing:

* REMIND Lizzie to update this later in the summer/fall when we have added in a few new studies.
