For converting thermal time to days to budburst, was able to convert heide93 Figure 3 & 4 and
karlsson03 Figure 1. 

The degree days equation they used was > 0 degC
The equation for heide93 is simply…
daystobudburst = degree days / force temp 

The degree days equation they used was > 2 degC
The equation for karlsson03 is…
daystobudburst = degree days / (force temp - 2)
