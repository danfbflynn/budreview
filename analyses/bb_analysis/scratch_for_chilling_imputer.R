###scartch for dan to think about chilling imputation 12 Dec 2017
### Here is my assesmenst

#Field Chill Units listed than maybe Ailene can calculate
  #biasi12
  #cook00b
  #nishimoto95

#entries with NA in chil calcs when should be 0
  #sogaard08	exp1<- 0 chilldays become NA in chillin calcs
  #sogaard08	exp2 <- 0 chilldays become NA in chillin calcs
  #sogaard08	exp3a<- 0 chilldays become NA in chillin calcs
  #sogaard08	exp1b<- 0 chilldays become NA in chillin calcs
  #thielges75 <- 0 chilldays become NA in chillin calcs
  #caffarra11b exp3 fig1 <- 0 chilldays become NA in chillin calcs
  #falusi96 exp2 field.chill==no
  #falusi96 exp3 field.chill==no
  #falusi90 exp1 field.chill==no

###same as above but need 0 chill days and 0 chill temp imputed
  #li05 other.treatment="short day controls"
  #junttila12 figure table if applicable==table2


#Entrie where chill temp could be added
  #sogaard08	exp3b <- chill temp 4

###we have lat and long and field sample data but chilling wasnt calculated
  #heide93 exp 3 just for corylus avenulla for some reason
  #caffarra11a exp1 <- database says no field sample date but paper says: 28 February 2004.
  #gheraldini10 exp1- need to imput field sample day from figure 2
  #gheraldini10 exp2-need to imput field sample day from figure 4

###studies we could impute chill temp and duration
  #heide12 exp3 2c for 10-12 week. Idea. 11 weeks?

###re-clean chilltemp column
  #granhus09 it "Chilling treatment at 0.7 \xb1 0.7 C interrupted by mild spells of 14 days duration at a constant temperature of 8 or 12 C"
    ###change to just 0.7

#Chilling hours until endodormancy release in table-not sre about this one
  #charrier11<-exp 1
  #charrier11<-exp 2 could be the same chilling requirement as above. 

#############Harder to fix##################

## multistep: 1) Lat long and field sample date 2) freeze treatment 3) exp chilling: figure 1
  #cook05: exp1 fig1: <- would need to re-extract from figure
##multistep: 1)Freeze treatment and 2)exp chilling
  #cook05: exp1 fig2,-would need to reextract chilling from figure 2

#Possible Impuation of field chilling dates
  #falusi96 exp1 fall 1987-?
  #falusi96 exp2 field.chill==yes begining october 1989
  #falusi96 exp3 field.chill==yes begining october 1990
  #falusi90 exp1 chilldays=winter  ? to first week of Febrary

###cant/wont fix
  #gansert02: only 4 rows would require climate data from multiple Mt Fugi Weather stations
