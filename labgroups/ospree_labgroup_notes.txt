Notes on working on question of which authors publish together, including:
(a) Getting bibtex file into usable author data!
(b) Gephi stuff

Getting bibtex file into usable author data!
<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

(1) Use jabref** to go from bibtex to a csv file 
Export the bibtex file into an openoffice/libreoffice csv file

(2) Manually do some cleanup (most things end up in the right column, but some years and keywords get mis-placed); I just have to manually clean it up. Most of the issues come from the authors getting placed in multiple cells, so I paste them back into one cell.

At this point I also did the following:
- removed all {\ { } “ ‘ from the authors field
- changed Hanninen, Heikki and Hanninen, Risto to always be HanninenH, Heikki and HanninenR, Risto. It’s not pretty but it works!

(3) I then grab the authors column, paste it into an empty TXT and re-read it into Excel, asking for the delimiters of & and semicolon (I could do this in R). I add the resulting new seven columns and name them aut1 … aut7.

(4) Ugh, that was messy. Now to R … 

**Problems with installing a working version of jabref:
Solved here: https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/issues/1481
Which says to use installation here: http://builds.jabref.org/master/

Gephi!
<><><><><><>

After much ridiculous effort to get the authors names into the format:
name1, name2, freq (aka, how many times there published together)

I could then just follow along here (see full code at bottom of page):

I wrote out both file versions …
I am pretty sure both the size of color of the circle display the betweeness in the current figures (because I manually changed this in Gephi), but I believe the automatic opening of gexf fie in Gephi gives you the color being degree and the size being betweeness.

Degree is: The degree of a vertex is its most basic structural property, the number of its adjacent edges. 

Betweenness is: The vertex and edge betweenness are (roughly) defined by the number of geodesics (shortest paths) going through a vertex or an edge.  (More here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality)

Note that I used forceatlas and nooverlap to help with visualization and I added the node labels.
