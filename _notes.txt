Trying to organize OSPREE issues …

*1* One cleaned file to rule them all (or at least just 1-3 files).

Ailene is using ospree_clean, which no longer exists — instead we have:
(1) ospree_clean_photo
(2) ospree_clean_respvar
(3) ospree_master_clean
(4) ospree

Also, note that Dan has files from August in mergearchive (outside analyses), which are probably where we should be building any cleaning files from.

We need way fewer files (or a really good README) to not lose any work.

*2* What is up with Revisiting folder? Can we delete?

*3* Tim’s notes within notes folder … can anyone read this file?

*4* data folder, let’s go through this together
