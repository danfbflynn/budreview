The goal of this lit review is to summarize differences in how chilling is measured/estimated/quantified and the implications of these differences. 

The spreadsheet contains the following columns:
strength_utah= strengths/benefits of using Utah units to quantify chilling, as outlined in the study
weak_utah= weaknesses/challenges of using Utah units to quantify chilling, as outlined in the study

thresh_utah=threshold temperature(s) to count as chilling, using Utah units (e.g. <0 degrees C).

strength_chillport= strengths/benefits of using chill portions (dyanmic model) to quantify chilling, as outlined in the study
weak_chillport= weaknesses/challenges of using chill portions to quantify chilling, as outlined in the study

thresh_chill=threshold temperature(s) to count as chilling, using chill portions (e.g. <0 degrees C).
strength_chillport


species= names of species included in the study

test_utah_cp= yes/no; was the difference between utah and chill portions actually tested?

other_notes= any other relevant notes.
