On 25 Jan 2017 Lizzie extracted this from the Teamwork site. See also howtoscrape_withnotes.pdf (and howtoscrape_withnotes.html) which is this, but with some back and forth notes on how to do this.

To to W: drive > WeldShare > Wolkovich Lab > Budburst Review > meta_analysis_labmembers > your folder

In your folder, you'll find a zip file for ImageJ; install this. Add the Figure_Calibration.class, which will help for giving x and y calibrations to images.

You each have an Excel workbook to add data to. Tim and I will manually merge data afterwards.

meta_general - metadata for each sheet

source - list of the paper we are working with. Bibliographic information and notes on usefulness for our purposes.Note the "ToDo" column, which tells you which figure or table to focus on. You may find other figures are better, these were from our initial quick read. Also pay attention to datasetID column, which tells you how you should enter the identifying information for each paper.

study - Details on each experiment within each paper; possibly only one line for a paper, if only one experiment is relevant. This sheet is useful for our overview of what kind of experimental manipulations were done.

data_simple - Aggregated data on each experimental treatment combination.

data_detailed - Detailed data for the experiment, with all relevant information filled out.

Responses may be pre/post treatment, time, or other. Temporal responses, such as days to 50% budburst, are fairly common. An example of an other type of response would be percent budburst, again fairly common.
scratch - For temporary formatting and manipulating data scraped from ImageJ.

The two most important tabs to fill out are study and data_detailed. We can aggregate data down to get the data_simple version later.

Open your PDF and find the designated figure or table as noted in the source tab of the worksheet. Also note the datasetID column in source; use this as you fill out data_detailed and study.

Take a screen shot and import into ImageJ, following Tim's instructions from lab meeting. Use the scratch tab to get data into the right format, and then copy into data_detailed. Fill out the study tab as best as possible to describe the experimental treatments used in each study within each publication.
