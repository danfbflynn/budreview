Basler2014,Cat,basler14,,negative,"negative (especially for Fagus, Acer and Quercus - less so for Picea)","negative (but only under long day conditions for Fagus,  however interaction of high forcing and long photo advanced budburst in all species but Acer which only responded to forcing)","species dependent: late successional are more dependent on photoperiod, especially with low chill; forcing is important for all; chilling important for all but less so for Picea which has a really low chilling requirement",
