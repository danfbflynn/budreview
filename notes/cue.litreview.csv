Caffarra2011b,Nacho,caffarra11b,Exp1-significant effect on time to bb;,Exp2-longer chilling -> shorter time to bb and >bbperc. Chilling interacts with photoperiod (more photoperiod needed at longer chilling exposures); Exp3 - chilling interacts with duration and temperature during dormancy induction (more bbperc in chilled plants exposed to low temperatures.,Exp2-significant effect on bbperc and almost significant on time to bb; Exp4- photoperiod during dormancy induction significantly affected on the timing of bb and bbperc; Exp4 -  photoperiod during chilling treatment had no significant effect on bbperc or bb timing.,Forcing/chilling

Heide2005,Nacho,heide05,NA,(<12C) determines growth cessation and dormancy induction in pear and apple trees. Prolonged chilling (<9C) over 6 weeks is needed to release dormancy.,no significant effect (other than internodal elongation),chilling
