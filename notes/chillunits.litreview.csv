Fairly comprehensive!Luedeling2013,Cat,,,,"(1) ""consistentlyƒ  outperform[s] all other common models""; (2) by incorporating an interactive effect of moderate chill temperatures (which increase the rate of chilling accumulation), the dynamic model tends to be more accurate","chill portions are not formed continuously, rather in a step-wise fashion, which made it essential to use hourly data and required smoothing after calculating",,"Castanea mollissima, Prunus sp (cherry crop in Germany), Juglans sp.
