Budburst phenology is determined by forcing, chilling, and photoperiod. We find that all three cues are important:
-Increased chilling advances budburst. This was the strongset and most consistent cue.
-Increased forcing advances budburst.
-Increased daylength advances budburst.
-The magnitude of these effects varies by species.
-The magnitude of photoperiod effects varies with latitude, with lower source latitudes generally having earlier budburst.


A fundamental challenge of understanding the relative roles of these three cues is that, in the real world, they are often strongly correlated. Chamber experiments often attempt to break this correlation to reveal mechanistic links between environmental conditions and budburst date. There are two main considerations in interpretting studies that attempt to do this:

1) Rarely, if ever, are these three cues fully independent in chamber experiments (e.g., longer daylength is generally associated with higher temperatures, since night-time temperatures are cooler). Some experimental methods are particularly prone to strong correlations (e.g., between chilling and photoperiod- and even forcing- in Weinberger studies)

2) Although breaking the inherent correlation between drivers may be useful for attaining mechanistic understanding, it is unclear the extent to which such studies can be used for forecasting under climate change. 

3) When we use chamber experiments to forecast future effects of warming, we find that much of the observed and predicted advances in budburst may be do to increased chilling, rather than increased forcing. For most species, we find effects of photoperiod are weaker than effects of forcing and chilling.
We also find that patterns of advancment with warming vary considerably depending on the current/background climate (e.g. how much advancement will continue with warming depends on how much chilling is currently experienced and whether that will increase or decrease with warming.)
